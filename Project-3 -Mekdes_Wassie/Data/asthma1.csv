Hello,

I'm just trying to figure out if it is possible to have a ""fluke"" PFT test. I've passed 2 methacholine challenge tests, an exercise challenge test, and multiple PFTs with plethysmography. All showing negative.

I just took a PFT though and the results were ""extreme asthma"". I'm talking feNO of 150 ppb, 215% RV, high DLCO, fvc/fev1 &lt; 70, etc. Is there any way this could be a fluke? Can any of this be attributed to patient effort? Testing environment, etc?",Asthma,Wildly Different PFT Results?,1631043480
5,"Hello, this past weekend I went to visit a friend who had their AC breakdown a little bit ago and it's been rainy the past couple of weeks (Ida went through here last week).

I stayed 2 nights there in his room (he has an AC unit) and had felt some issues arise after the first night, but I just assumed they were average allergies. After getting home, they got worse and I was worried I had COVID, but I didn't have any of the trademark symptoms (lack of taste/smell, fever, chills, runny nose, none of that). I just had difficulty getting full breaths, bad sleep, occasional dry cough, and my sinuses are dry like I had a sneezing fit.

I was confused until I remembered I had used a toilet that he and his roommate don't use often (they each have their own and this one was an extra), which I came to discover had black mold growing under the seat/in the bowl after I had already used/flushed it a few times. I guess the small bathroom, lack of light, and no central AC in the house caused it to become a perfect breeding ground.

I take a daily 24 hr non-drowsy allergy pill and had to bust out my nebulizer both of which are helping, but am also uninsured which is making this extra fun.

I'm away from the mold and back home, but I've still been dealing with these symptoms since Sunday. Yesterday and last night were rough, but I've been feeling a little better today after using my nebulizer on the reg.

Does anyone have any experience with this? I've considered taking a hot bath or shower for the steam, but I also am worried about introducing more moisture. I am probably overly worried about it, but I just wanted to check if anyone else has dealt with a situation like this.",Asthma,Breathed in Mold Without Realizing,1631043146

7,"So I’m a 26 year old male, relatively healthy and no underlying conditions. I’ve always had seasonal allergies with ragweed being by far the worst one.

My symptoms were always the same classics such as runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes. Annoying but fairly well-controlled with otc antihistamines.

However, this summer I’ve developed symptoms that are indicative of asthma; wheezing, a ton of coughing (usually productive), and mild shortness of breath, and the combination of these makes it extremely difficult to talk and get out full sentences. 

There’s a very clear correlation between these symptoms coming on and me being outdoors, especially for longer periods. Also exercise seems to worsen it as well, for example I was playing golf the other day and had to run like 200 yards back to pick up a club I had forgotten, and 3/4 of the way I started wheezing and had to sit down because I got lightheaded from not getting enough air.

So based on all that, I think the most likely case is that I’ve developed allergy-induced asthma. I do have an appointment set up with my primary care doctor to address the symptoms I’ve been having but the soonest I could get in is a month from now.

Anybody else have a similar experience? And any advice from asthma veterans out there on how to manage this until I can see a doctor is also appreciated!",Asthma,I think I developed allergy-induced asthma as an adult,1631035949

11,"I am a researcher, OCD by nature. I never assume anything and I ask a billion questions. I have never been relaxed…ever. 

When I randomly developed severe allergies and chronic cough asthma last year when I was previously never allergic to ANYTHING and never once took allergy medication, and I’m 31, I figured out I was allergic to dustmites mainly. And mold. 

Cut to VACUUM RESEARCH: i learned a lot about HEPA filters, looked into getting an air purifier, joined the Facebook allergies &amp; asthma group and was turned onto the infamous Wirecutter review of all the air purifiers. Dyson and molekule were ripped to shreds. 

….Realized that vacuums need certified HEPA filters. Those HEPA filters need to be 100% sealed. I thought for sure dyson has a sealed HEPA filter vacuum….I spoke with maybe 20  dyson corporate people including people in their r&amp;d. No dyson vaccuum has a completely sealed HEPA filter (like what was just implemented into their brand new T7 and T9 air purifiers, but *only* as a response to the Wirecutter article. 

So basically everything is a scam. Dyson is written up, and has provided so much material information to a ton of “allergy friendly websites” that then market their shit and literally label it as “sealed HEPA filter”. It’s NOT. 






…..So. Here I am. Wondering where I can get a fully sealed HEPA vacuum or do I just have to invent one?

Has anyone else come across this besides me? 

I have a rainbow vacuum, it has this huge massive separate HEPA filter but I don’t even think that is technically sealed- maybe it is? 

MIELE, a german brand, says they offer vaccums that have sealed HEPA filtration but who knows. They are the only ones that I see use that information on THEIR website though (an important key here)

I ve been to my alergologist, i had the spiromethry test (what a bull\*hit). He took my blood and afaik, im allergic to dust, specifically dust mites and that triggers my asthma. He prescribed me an Alvesco and Ventolin. I need to tell you, that my doctor is totally incompetent and he told me almost nothing. I didnt know anything about asthma as im 22 years old and never had any problem. So i had to look it up all on internet. I started using Alvesco (1x puff a day) - it was good for a like 1 month. I was almost like a normal person again (without coughing)...After that, my symptoms came back - i called my doctor and he told me that its not worth to take 1x puff twice a day and told me, that i should take ventolin. The thing is, i cant go without ventolin and i dont want to use it every day. So by myself, i started to do 1x puffs twice a day Alvesco. My symptoms dissapeared. After a week, all is back the same. Im desperate, i cant take ventolin every day. I am terrified, that my body is immune to the Alvesco. 

I also need to tell you, that i live in extremely humid apartment - Yesterday morning, there was 80% humidity. Now, i have dehumidifier running and humidity is currently 65%. And it rarely goes below the 60%, even when the dehumidifier is running. And when i will open the window, the humidity is back. I dont know what to do. All day, every day i am coughing phlegm and im so tired of it. My alergologist doesnt tell me a sh\*t. I dont know, should i buy better dehumidifier? Should i buy an air purifier? And i cant move anywhere else and also, i need to be in this room, as we had online lectures. Also, my symptoms are better, when i am cycling or i am in the nature.

I am a sufferer of asthma – since I was little. I've had my lungs collapse a couple times and needed to be put on oxygen. From then on, I regularly use inhalers. My asthma is triggered by dust, pollen, the cold, and too much physical exertion.

Tomorrow is my medical check up for the military as per the conscription process (forced enrollment in the military). I imagine conscription is tough for everyone in the world but where I live, it's particularly bad. Process for conscription alone has so far proved to be the worst thing I have ever experienced.

Tomorrow I will be examined by a pulmonologist (I think). Despite my history with asthma and my regular use of inhalers, my case for inability to participate will probably be dismissed because I will appear fine – and I \*am\* fine. They will not care that I suffer from it and can only prevent it through access to water, my inhaler, and a controlled environment.

One thing that will definitely distinguish me though is if I'm actively suffering. This means if I'm wheezing and having difficulty breathing, they will take me seriously.

15,"I started having an asthma flare up back in March. It took them until June to figure out that it was my asthma because I haven't had active asthma since I was a little kid (I'm 29 now). I haven't had to use an inhaler and the only time it ever caused me issues was when I was around smoke. They try and rescue inhaler and it didn't do anything. Then they put me on Flovent and it helped but I still have a persistent cough and I still have moderate attacks. They wanted me to do a pulmonary function test before giving me anything else so I did and it came back that I have breathing problems but there was no difference between my breathing problems before and after and Albuterol breathing treatment.

I'm trying to get in to see a pulmonologist but with Covid they're in high demand. In the meantime my primary care physician is trying different inhalers to see if we can find one that works. I tried to Advair and after only one day I was significantly worse. I was back to having a near constant cough and having big attacks that left me having to sit down and recover. Now I'm trying Breo and it does seem like my asthma has gotten a little bit worse after 2 days on Breo but I'm not sure if I should give in a little longer before I call my doctor again.

22,"
This past winter I (21f) moved to a city, where my house sits right on the side of a highway, and 1/4 mile from the freeway. The air quality is usually awesome here (northern Minnesota, so lots of trees and this city is very nature-oriented). But I noticed that going for runs in my neighborhood near the highway were becoming extremely difficult — my pace was slower than it’s ever been, and I was struggling to breathe more and more. Running in the winter made me wheeze and cough more than ever, even though I’ve coughed a bit in cold weather my entire life. 

I’m a pretty healthy person, but I was worried I might have developed asthma on top of a couple seasonal allergies I have. Apparently my mother (who is not in my life anymore), developed severe asthma and allergies in her early twenties. I went to the doctor and she gave me a prescription for an Albuterol inhaler for before my runs. I noticed it helped a lot, as it cut about 2 minutes off my mile times immediately (bringing me back to my usual times) and I didn’t feel nearly as exhausted after runs. 

This spring, I started getting what I think are asthma attacks or flare-ups a few times a week — often brought on by allergies and high humidity. I went back to my doctor and started on Montelukast (on top of my daily Xyzal and albuterol as needed). 

This summer, my breathing was still troublesome and forest fires started in Canada and northern Minnesota. The smoke has become my worst enemy — I plan my days around wind direction and AQI. I went back to my doctor and she added a Flovent inhaler 2x a day. 

That week, the forest fires near me really started to act up, and I ended up in the ER unable to breathe after working outdoors at my job all day. I felt much better after the doctor gave me a high dose of Prednisone and 3 DuoNeb treatments. He sent me home with a nebulizer machine, a prescription for DuoNeb, and a magical thing for my inhaler called a spacer, which no other doctor has ever mentioned to me. The spacer has been a game changer for the effectiveness of my inhalers. As the forest fires continue, this arsenal of medicine has become a necessity for me. I have to carry my Albuterol on me at all times, and it’s to the point where I don’t go to work without my entire nebulizer kit as well. 

Since I’m still having issues, I was referred to an allergist for allergy testing. My appointment still isn’t until the end of September. My issue, though, is that no doctor has done any actual asthma testing on me — they keep sending me away with more and more medication to rely on, and the most they’ve done is listened to my lungs with a stethoscope and said they sound “perfect.”

Has anyone experienced anything similar, or have an inkling as to what might be going on? I’m not looking for medical advice, moreso support, or tips to at least get me until this allergy testing in a little under a month.

40,"Greetings Fellow Asthmanaughts,

Did I do that right?  I’m new.  Well, sort of.  I could really use advice.

My mom smoked around me when I was a kid.  My childhood asthma was bad.  Steam showers, nebulizers, inhalers, bronchitis every time I was sick.

Once I started playing lots of sports around age 10, I never noticed it again until now, about 20 years later.  Things are different.  Instead of sports, I rarely exercise, especially these past 2 years.  I never used to smoke/vape, but I did a fair amount the past ~10 years (with no noticeable issues).  I currently do not smoke/vape at all.

Last weekend, I couldn’t have been any worse to my poor lungs.  I was on vacation in Sequoia which is close to a wildfire right now, and we could smell the smoke for the 4 days we were there.  I was on vacation, so I smoked and vaped some but not that much.  I was the lucky first one in the hot tub and received what I can only describe as the heaviest dose of vaporized chlorine I’ve ever inhaled.  I had to get out - eyes burning, couldn’t breathe.  That didn’t last long, no skin irritation, able to enjoy the tub the rest of the weekend.  Surprisingly, no general breathing trouble all weekend despite that onslaught.

First night home Monday, no trouble, but that next morning, this past Tuesday, I woke up a few hours early because I was wheezing.  Couldn’t get air, couldn’t sleep.  Eventually subsided later in the day.  The same thing has happened to me every morning this week since, and I’m exhausted.  I have a rescue inhaler, never used it before, never needed it, finally did today and breathing was relieved immediately (still couldn’t sleep due to steroid).  It is worth mentioning our cat sleeps with us.  Again, no issues in the past, but certainly a potential contributor.

Is it possible my childhood asthma simply and coincidently caught up with me and this isn’t abnormal?  If so, why is this only happening early morning?  Is it possible I just over did it a bit this weekend, and I’ll be back to usual in a few days?  Is it possible something more serious is going on due to the chlorine incident or something else?  I read about a scary chlorine incident that sent people to the hospital, but I wouldn’t say I’ve needed emergency care the past few days.

I’m cv19 vaccinated, may have had cv19 in the past or not - no idea, no other symptoms, and can breathe fine during the day, and it doesn’t feel like I need an emergency room.  I’m just tired af and trying to figure out what is happening and what to do.

Should I take the rescue inhaler (albuterol) more often?  If so, how often do y’all typically take it?  My doctor told me to let him know when I use it, and I think I understand correctly using it too often can result in diminishing returns.  I just don’t want to use it improperly.

Are there any other ‘new to asthma’ steps you’d recommend?

My heart was beating really fast but thats because  im longhauling and still dont do well with exercise and i walked pretty fast(forgot to pace myself).

The fast heart beat wouldn't stop on its own without meds so now everytime it beats fast during normal activities like chores or walking i get scared thinking its tachycardia. I focus to much on my breathing and then cause panic from feeling like im not breathing enough when in reality im hyperventilating.

87,"Hey guys. So during the last ~4 months or so I’ve been suffering from a chronic cough that causes me to have horrible coughing fits. At first it started off as a tickle in the throat which caused me to have a coughing fit, which my doctor and I assumed was due to post nasal drip as I’ve had allergies and sinus issues in the past (had sinus surgery in August of last year). So i was told to take Allegra during the day, Zyrtec at night, and 2 pumps of flonase twice a day.

After not having relief from that, I was started on an albuterol inhaler to see if that helped. It did for a little while so I was started on a steroid inhaler to take in addition to it as well as montelukast. This was around 7/15 of this year. I felt like my coughing had improved a couple of weeks ago but now I feel like I’m back to square one.

The past Wednesday I went in for PFT and was told that my lung capacity was within normal limits (88%) but my output of air showed that I’m trapping air in my lungs. The man who did the testing suggested I blow up a few balloons a day to help. When my doctor saw my results later on she said she’s not used to seeing it in someone my age and that she usually sees it in someone older who has been smoking for a large portion of their life. I have been smoking weed almost daily for the past 4 years (like half a bowl) but stopped once these issues got worse.

Does anyone have advise on how to navigate this? It’s been so frustrating trying to figure out what’s wrong with me and it’s been interfering with my sleep and work. Today I had ~3 coughing fits before 11 am, even after taking my albuterol inhaler around 7:30 am, and one fit was so bad it caused me to throw up. My doctor said she has to wait for the interpretation of my PFT before she changes up my meds and I have an appointment with her in 2.5 weeks. Does anyone hav any advice on what might help me in the meantime?

I know that the overwhelming response to this would be to see a doctor, but thought I'd reach out to this community to at least see if this sounds like asthma and if any similar experiences have been had.

I had COVID in June (was single jabbed at the time) and it was all in all, a very mild affair. As it wound down, I found that a cough lingered and since then, I've become very ""wheezy"" at times. Most often in the middle of the night.

Last night for example I woke to find myself wheezing and coughing, for about 2 hours from 3:30am-5:30am. I eventually took an anti-histamine and afterwards I managed to get to sleep again. Anti-histamines seem to help, so dont know if its allergy induced or just placebo. 

Prior to COVID i'd never had any kind of experience like this (im 32 years old) - the closest thing being what appeared to be slight exercise induced asthma (tightness in chest after running). I might sneeze a bit in Summer due to pollen, but nothing breathing related and dust etc. never bothered me before. Never had to take antihistamines in my life before.

I never really feel a tightness in my chest or unable to breath during this, simply really loud audible wheezing that leads onto a bit of coughing - that then stops the wheezing for a minute and then cycle and repeat.

27,"Hello! I'm currently 15 years old and have had trouble breathing for a while now. 
(This is a long story, sorry.)

A bit of a backstory:
I've always had issues with breathing, but I kind of just ignored my symptoms because I figured that they were linked to colds and allergies. Before Covid hit, and even before the mask mandates, I used to get sick maybe once every month. Somewhere at the start of the month (or midway), I would catch a cold. This cold would turn into a long, persistent cough that wouldn't go away for the life of me (along with congestion). I remember precisely that my cough would be phlegmy for a bit, but would subside into a dry, wheezy, and nagging cough. This became the norm. I would catch a cold, have it develop into something making it last longer (for the duration of the month), and then end up with a cough that would not go away, even after I was pretty sure I was done being sick. Then after like a two week break maybe, I'd get sick again, and they cycle would continue.

Since then I haven't had a cold in nearly two years (I think because of the masks, and I was out of school for 2 years for online learning). I can't remember much about my symptoms back then, other than that stupid cough with a wheeze, my chest feeling constricted, and being sick for far longer than anyone should be - especially for a common cold. 

Now, I've recently started taking notice of my daily symptoms over the duration of 2-3 months. 
-Itchy, watery and irritated eyes (although they're itchy and watery 24/7, regardless of the season)
-Postnasal drip, congestion (24 hours day/night)
-sneezing mainly during spring/summer
-Shortness of breath (During exercise &amp; laughing - ends with a coughing fit, walking for prolonged periods of time, before bed, walking up stairs, etc.). Issues with getting air into my lungs - feels like there's a cap to how much air my lungs will let me take in, rather than getting the air out (although I do have struggles getting air out, too).
-Chest tightness when I'm around triggers such as smoke, really hot and dry air, cold and wet air, etc. Feels like a rubber band is around my lungs.
-Wheezing (inhaling and exhaling, mostly exhaling), with a dry cough every morning and every night, a couple times around noon.

For clarification, I do go to the doctor the 27th of August. Although I'm not exactly sure how I should bring up these symptoms to her (should I just tell her exactly this?), and what to expect when I do tell her. If you have any advice, please share. I do apologize for how long this explanation was, but I figured it might be helpful for you guys to know some details, and whether they'd be relevant to the situation or not. They're there just in case.

Hoping to get some input from folks who’ve experienced asthma attacks, so I figured I’d shoot my shot here. 

Note: I am not asking this in place of a professional opinion. I have an appointment for allergy testing next week!

Long story short, last night I was out to dinner and experienced what I assumed to be an allergic reaction to something I ate. My main symptom was a persistent, mucus-y cough (gross, sorry) that didn’t subside for at least an hour. It was like I had the persistent urge to cough constantly. I never felt the sensation that my throat was closing or that I couldn’t breathe exactly, but I definitely felt a bit wheezy due to the mucus I could feel. I also felt itchy under my chin. I popped a few Benadryl because I assumed I was allergic to something. But upon doing some reading, it almost seems like what I experienced was closer to an asthma attack. So I guess my question is: does anyone have experience with differentiating an allergic reaction to an asthma attack?

I also had no clue that I had allergies, so all of this is new to me.

No issues breathing once I’m fully asleep though. No history of anxiety.

I stopped taking the nightly puff of Advair 250 and only took the morning dose, and the sleeping issues went away immediately. My allergist called in a lower dosage of Advair 100 to see if my heart tolerates it better.

The last year my breathing has gotten really bad. If I'm sitting, it feels like I have to work hard just to breathe. Usually, this only happens if I get a cold but this past year, it's happened a few times so my doctor had me do a pulmonary function test.

When I had the test done, I could see the results and the did it pre- and post- inhaler but my results never changed after using an inhaler (bronchodilators). The person giving the test said my lung valves looks clear but my function is lower than it should be.

The day after that incident, I started feeling better so I just figured it was cause my body wasn’t used to running. 

Then at the end of May, I had a 3 hour long allergy attack (I assume that’s what it was?) out of nowhere I started coughing, sneezing, runny + stuffy nose. Ever since then I’ve been wheezing and coughing consistently. After a month of trying to ignore it, the symptoms got to be too much so I had my PCP prescribe an albuterol inhaler. At first I was using it twice a day, then I started needing it 4+ times per day. Mid-July I went to the ER where they gave me an x-ray which was clear but the doctor said my lungs sounded really bad and she was sure I have adult onset asthma. I started a 5 day course of  prednisone, then followed up with PCP on day 4. He told me my lungs still sounded bad so he had me do an additional 10 day course of prednisone. It worked and after 15 days I was finally not wheezing and could breathe like normal. 

It’s now been 3 weeks since I stopped the steroids and I feel awful.

Anyway. In my science class, we were working with clay dust. We were expressly told not to inhale it, but my teammate and I were idiots and we're patting the dust and making clouds that I inhaled.

I’ve felt like that only recently and it wasn’t anything sever at all and it was just slightly annoying , when I run I feel fine but my lungs give out before my legs do so I wonder if that’s something I should worry about or if I’m just not used to running , after I get done running sometimes I cough and have a very slight wheeze if I inhale 2 much but that’s when I push myself hard when running .
(haven’t had that in a while when I run but I’ve had very mild coughs after which end in like 5 mins or less) 
Yesterday I feel like I’ve gotten worse , when I inhale deeply and get a good thing of air then exhale I hear a very slight whistle sound (only when I exhale after inhaling a lot of oxygen by looking my head up and inhaling as I was told that helps increase air intake)  I’ve never had that before or at least I’ve never noticed it which worries me .

Today I did the fitness gram pacer test at school and I pushed my self and the only thing holding me back was me being out of breath but I feel like that’s just me not being experienced with running , I felt fine but I did feel like I was breathing heavier then others although I could just be overthinking it and paranoid since the speaker is playing and their breaths probably can’t even be heard by me .

Like they were very mildly burning , not painful or to the point where it made me want to stop but it felt like I was working out a muscle . After it took like a minute or 2 to slow down my breathing and I was gasping for air but I out of breath . Around 10 mins go by and I don’t feel like I need to cough.

Edit: I felt a small tingle in my throat , easily ignorable but if I cough it was a very small wheeze cough (a single cough ) and I think it was because of the way I projected my air out when I coughed .

My fiancee suggested we go outside so I could get some fresh air. I was scared to walk because my limbs felt shakey. Somehow I made it into our backyard with my towel and I continued wheezing and gasping for air for like 10mins before I started feeling the pressure on my lungs easing up.

16,"I think I need to hear from others like me with asthma to help me better understand what is considered feeling normal with asthma and/or what is considered well-controlled.

IDK if age and stuff matters but 36/M/Good Shape.

Currently I'm on Arnuity Ellipta 200mg/day....which was increased about 2 months ago now from 100mg. I use a rescue inhaler when needed and before any workouts.

I could go into a lot of detail but I think for now I'm just curious what do you all consider ""normal"" living or Well-controlled asthma?

I know weather and stuff effects me for sure, plus allergies but I'm really not sure mine is considered well controlled. I use a peak flow at home to monitor and it always seems the same even when I'm not feeling great, so I don't think that's a good indicator. Unfortunately my asthma doctor seems to think that is the best way to tell if i need increases or different meds...etc. But I'm like, I KNOW how I'm feeling. 

Lately I've been having a cough. Its not horrible but it comes and goes, my chest feels eh but again not terrible. I know we asthmatics tend to ""normalize"" these things so I'm just like, what is NORMAL? And/or how do I get to a place where aside from OBVIOUS triggers, I should be able to do moderate activity without coughing or be outside on a humid day without being like, sorry no outside life for you. 

Sorry this is mostly a rant I guess, but the main point is, what's normal and do you all have any suggestions for other meds that help. I often think about why my doctor hasnt thought about something like  Singulair (Montelukast).  OH i've tried Breo, I cant remember how well that really worked for me, and i've tried symbicort....doesn't work and made me feel crappy. 

Thoughts?

hello everyone,

I would really appreciate it if you took the time to help me with your experience.

I am currently on the 250 dose (not sure if mg or what) of Advair (I’m sure many of you know it is an asthma steroid - this is the only medicine I have other than a rescue inhaler). I take it twice a day. With this medicine, my breathing is very good. I can run regularly without any issues. I don't have any symptoms unless I forget to take my Advair twice a day.

I am hoping to stop taking this medicine, but I don't know if it would be safe. Ideally, I would like to stop taking any medicine, but I don't know if this is an option.  

I have asked my doctor about this once, and they said that I should try not taking it for a while and using my inhaler as needed. I tried this, and I was constantly short of breath and I used my inhaler daily (this was over a year ago and I don't remember the full details of my symptoms). I didn’t try avoiding my inhaler and Advair at the same time, though. I eventually gave up and went back to Advair. I never have to take my inhaler while I am taking Advair. I won’t be able to get an appointment with my doctor for a while, so I chose to seek help on the internet.

Have any of you had a similar experience? How old were some of you when you outgrew Asthma? Has anyone outgrown it as an adult (like at age 30, for example)?

I asked him what mine was and he says since you quit smoking so long ago it's probably a little bit of both but mostly asthma. I'm asking this question because every few days or so I have so much phlegm in my lungs and try to cough it up. I don't know if this is also a symptom of asthma.

76,"I’ve lived with asthma my hole life (my first memory is an asthma attack that had me in the hospital), but for many years I lived in somewhat denial of how bad my asthma was. I recently went in for allergy testing, and my breathing numbers were really bad, so I was put on twice-a-day Flovent HFA. After one dose, within minutes, I was amazed at how well I could breath, and now I’m determined to actually take care of my asthma symptoms, however I am having some side effects from the medication and am noticing just how often I get asthma symptoms in a day. I’m looking for advice regarding these things:

1. The steroid inhaler is majorly irritating my mouth and throat. The first time I took my inhaler, it was just itchiness, but after two days it’s now constant pain. I’ve looked in my mouth, and the areas that are bothering my are really red, and the pain in my throat and roof of mouth is making it hard for me to eat. I do wash my mouth well (including gargling and teeth brushing after each dose), and I also am following the correct technique. Will this go away once I get used to it? Is there anything I can do to mitigate this? I have a spacer for my emergency use inhaler, should I use it with the Flovent HFA as well? I am also considering only taking the dose at night and not in the morning. I go back to see the doctor who prescribed it next Friday to check how the treatment is treating me.

2. Just when should I be using my emergency inhaler? I often get really mild wheezing, and I try to use it then, but this has resulted in me using it at least once a day. I know from the years where I was under the false impression that my symptoms were just normal that I can get away with not taking it under these circumstances.

79,"Hey all,  


  
I've posted here once before, late last year or so. I have been having shortness of breath/chest tightness issues ongoing for the past 16 months or so now. I've been through all the motions test wise, seeing my primary care provider, gastroenterologist, allergist, pulmonologist, and ENT doctor. I am apparently highly allergic to pollen, weeds, grass, and dust mites after an allergy test. Allergic asthma would seem to make sense, however when I went in for my spirometry test, the pulmonologist said I had ""normal"" numbers, not indicative of someone with asthma.   


  
I then followed up with a methacholine challenge test and had zero reaction to it. My breathing numbers after the fifth and final dosage during the test were higher than my baseline numbers. The pulmonologist stated that it is ""extremely unlikely"" that I have reactive airway disease (asthma.)  


  
I have had VCD ruled out recently by an ENT after scoping me, even after exercise which is when the shortness of breath hits hardest.  


I have had an EKG, chest CT scan with the injectable dye, and echocardiogram done on my heart to rule out blood clots or heart issues.  


  
I guess my question to you guys is do any of you get relief from ICS or the like even though you may have presented with normal spirometry or methacholine test numbers? Do any of you experience asthma symptoms but don't have any of the traditional wheezing or coughing symptoms? I don't cough or wheeze at all, just shortness of breath with mucus production and chest tightness. Albuterol will take the edge off for me, just doesn't eliminate symptoms completely. I'm wondering if it's worth going on some form of ICS or the like to see if it helps anyway. I don't want to become dependent on using the albuterol for relief.

My pulmonologist told me to start taking 2x200mg a day, which is what I'm currently taking. But now my asthma is gradually slipping out of control again. The dosage doesn't suppress my symptoms for as long as it used to, sometimes no longer than 10 hours before I can feel mucus rasping in my chest or taste it on my breath. I sometimes wake up pain in the bottom of my chest, which thankfully goes away quickly. Exercise winds me faster than before, even with my bronchodilator inhaler. I still breathe fine, I don't have attacks unless triggered by one of my few allergies. All things considered, I'm probably not that bad off.

She is on around 5 different asthma medications, the max allowed of every single one possible, and would still need to do her albuterol nebulizer multiple times some days.  She has been on prednisone on top of all of that for months at a time.  

On top of the asthma, she has had really bad acid reflux.  It is well known there is a connection between acid reflux and asthma, since you breathe in the acid.  We wanted to fix the acid reflux both to stop that pain and because we hoped it would help her asthma.  What we didn't know - and we don't think is well known - is that the acid reflux was a mechanical issue due to her esophagus sphincter not closing correctly due in part to a hiatal hernia.  She went in for surgery to install a medical device called a linx that closes the sphincter (thereby fixing the mechanical issue) but at the same time the surgeon fixed a 2-3 cm hiatal hernia.  

Immediately after the surgery, she felt like she could breath much much better.  We researched it, and found a study that showed that a test group of patients with severe asthma and acid reflux/GERD experienced massive improvement in their asthma symptoms after the hiatal hernia fix/esophagus fix.    She said that she feels like she can finally expel all the air in her lungs, and although she still has some asthma her symptoms are much better.  She thinks that her asthma was in part a mechanical issue, and that the hiatal hernia repair fixed that (hiatal hernia is at your diaphragm).  

I wanted to share since we really wish we had known this years ago.  If you have asthma combined with bad reflux/GERD and lifestyle changes don't fix it, then I would recommend looking into surgery.",Asthma,Hiatal Hernia Surgery Repair Led to Massive Improvement in Asthma,1628288425

So I don't have asthma (s far as I know) but my sister does.

My sister said it reminds her of her asthma. I went to see a GP but she did blood tests instead and said they were fine so I must be fine. She did listen with her stethoscope, and seemed to think it was fine...

It was a rather controversial diagnosis -- my Spirometry results were bad, and the bronchodilator response was negative, but the test was technically flawed, so it was disregarded in the diagnosis itself. I have some doubts about whether the diagnosis is right or not, which causes a lot of stress and anxiety. Regardless, I was at a hospital, had a CT with contrast, bronchoscopy and a ton of blood tests and it ruled out a lot of bad stuff, so doctors went with asthma diagnosis based on signs of chronic inflammation in the bronchis and a clean CT. I'm currently taking Symbicort and Montelukast and I feel better. I've been taking them for a month now, but I still get symptoms. When I first went to the ER I could barely breathe at all.

Also, the o2 reading can be somewhat compromised because Pulseoximeters do need some time to show accurate reading, but I'm sure it drops because normally the value is instantly within the normal range, but when I get the sensations it can start off with even below 90% range then climb back up quickly when the symptoms resolve. I have doubts about the diagnosis and really worry about this symptom. It only happens at night and when I try to fall asleep -- when I close my eyes.

After stopping Flixotide he had a big asthma attack. Then we went to a different pulmonologist and they told us that corticosteroids would be really damaging for him in the long-run and they suggested Xyzal nasal drops.

Throughout the years we've been treating his asthma attacks with Ventolin and eventually Medrol (Once or twice a year, when the Ventolin didn't help).  

We're currently threating him mainly with Xyzal (and Ventolin whenever he has an asthma attack). We've been to a few pulmonologists in the last year and a few of them insisted on Pulmicort treatment, while the other few told us that we need to tackle the allergy (and they also told us that Pulmicort would be bad for him and is a harsh treatment for such a young child). 

I think that's pretty much all of it. Now the dilemma is what to do - Should we continue to try and tackle the allergy, or should we go for corticosteroids (Pulmicort), or is there another alternative? What about Salbutamol or will that be bad for him as well?

I have also a rescue inhaler (salbutamol) but I didn’t need to use it until this summer.

On july I had my first asthma flare up since when I got the diagnosis. My doctor prescribed me Montelukast, and my symptoms, such as shortness of breath, went away. However, two weeks ago I got sick and had a mild flu and the familiar symptoms came back. I was adviced to take more doses of the prevention inhaler for a week. It has been now a little bit over a week, and I had maybe 3-4 days when my asthma symptoms had completely disappeared - but now they are back!

I’m so tired of these symptoms. It’s so annoying that suddenly my old medication isn’t enough, and I don’t know what has happened. I’m not sick anymore, and the flu was really really mild - only a slighlty sore throat. Has anyone had similar experiences with these random asthma flare ups?

Not very physically active
GERD, Sleep Apnea, GAD

The last two days, I’ve become incredibly breathless during physically activity specifically moving furniture and walking up a very steep hill at work. The more intense the heat is, the worse the symptoms are.

I’ve been largely physically inactive for two years, but I’ve always really struggled with walking up steep hills even when in decent physical shape and have always struggled to run outdoors. Indoors, I’m usually okay.

When these episodes happen, I cannot talk and walk at the same time, my nose dries out, my mouth dries out, and I feel like I can’t breathe in at all. I breathe through my mouth almost like I’m gasping, but can get it better when I breathe through my nose. I then struggle to breathe for about 20-30 minutes. I am not short of breath, but I have to breathe shallow.

I have an inhaler that does seem to help. Once my heart rate hits about 120 or so, the breathlessness starts. Once my Hr returns to a normal level, I’m fine. This happens in my home as well, but not as concerning.

This is a new development as the same work hill didnt bother me just 2 months ago before the school year ended. I saw an allergist and he suspects potentially mild asthma but nothing worse. I have no allergies.

I've had exercise-induced asthma for a while, but recently noticed some mild symptoms that made me think my asthma was getting worse (struggle with intense exercise even after a couple of puffs/some very rare breathlessness before sleep). I went to a new pulmonologist since I recently moved to a new country. My lung capacity was normal. But, he prescribed the Foster inhaler (beclometasone and formoterol) for two weeks to see if my lung function test improves with the medication. He said if it does then my lungs are likely getting worse (since the improved function test would indicate the inhaler had a positive effect). 

My question is: Is this a normal way to test if I need further treatment? I'm a little concerned about going onto an anti-inflammatory and would prefer testing my progression without taking these meds. What have been your experiences to test the progression of your exercise-induced asthma?

85,"Hey reddit,
I was diagnosed with Asthma in around September 2019. It was originally just like a tickle that would get in my throat and a dry cough, maybe a tiny bit of wheezing and airway inflammation. This seemed like just regular asthma or the common cough variants I see on here. They prescribed me QVAR and Flovent (doubled my dosage for about the first week).       
Symptoms calmed down until around February to March. I lost the tickling feeling in my throat and developed a wet cough. Wet cough became literally my only symptom. It wasn't too bad at first, but it was impairing my abilities to exercise by around June or July, and I went to the doctor again in around December of 2020.     
They prescribed me Advair and Xopenex, as well as Xithromax and Prednisone, apparently just to clear out any buildup. I think the Xithromax and Prednisone did help a lot, it cleared out much of my symptoms and I was able to exercise and laugh almost without any symptoms for a few good months. Recently however, the wet cough has come back, and it has been hitting hard. I've used phlegm removal strategies like huff cough, which is the only reason that I can function during exercise. Despite this, my airways are just always producing mucus and I would end up having to clear my airways out again after a few hours or especially after eating some sort of fast food or sweet, sugary foods.    

In addition, I have developed a sort of nasal drip over the past couple weeks (seasonal allergies were normal for me, so I did not think much of it), and it has been exacerbating my symptoms, I think. Really, I think my asthma has been the worst controlled it has ever been, I have just used huff cough and other breathing techniques to expel mucus often, making it sort of possible to exercise.      

I am contemplating taking the Xithromax (antibiotic) again to see if it will help anything, is that safe? If it doesn't help I'm going back to the doctor. Is there any advice you guys can give me? Am I being misdiagnosed?     

TL;DR: dry cough, regular asthma or cough variant symptoms evolve into just a wet cough within around 6 months of diagnosis (QVAR, Flovent). Wet cough has been with me since around March 2020, and after being prescribed Advair and Xopenex, as well as Xithromax and Prednisone for a few days just to clear up buildup in December, 2020 I felt a few months of no symptoms coming up at all. Since around April 2021, I have been not able to function comfortably, esp. with exercising and laughing. I'm about to take Xithromax again to see if it helps, is it safe to do that? And am I being misdiagnosed? None of my prescriptions have held up long term. Is there any advice anyone can give me?",Asthma,Consistent wet cough,1627653424

89,"Maybe that sounds dramatic. Maybe you understand. Before being prescribed it, I was having multiple asthma attacks a day. Using my rescue up to 4 separate times too many days. I don't think I'd have been able to survive another month. Almost every other night I was having attacks so bad I probably needed the er, but I live alone and couldn't breathe enough to call 911. Thinking back on those nights, I was so lucky I survived. It was terrifying, coughing so violently out of *literally* nowhere while not being able to bring in enough air, making me gag. Agonizing minutes passing just waiting for the rescue inhaler to work, the exhaustion, the *soreness* that comes with particularly bad attacks. Now I'm 3 doses in. There was some improvement after the first, as early as a week after the first I remember realizing I was using my rescue less. The second brought more improvement, but I was getting worried because I wasn't where I wanted to be. But I was using my rescue *maybe* once a week. This 3rd dose though. Now I can tell my shortness of breath this time is from being seriously out of shape. But I could complete a 15 minute HIIT cardio workout! Even better than the first time I tried it before developing this stupid asthma!

I have only needed my inhaler twice in the past 3 weeks. Once because the hood system went out at work filling the whole store with thick greasy smoke and I didn't get my mask on quickly enough, and the second today due to a very high heat and humidity combo. I was able to go to an amusement park with my sister and family and walk around in the heat without needing it.

He hasn't seen the results yet as they were ordered by my hematologis who works for a different hospital group, so it's gonna be a fun little surprise for him. Or maybe he'll be expecting it.

26,"I know a lot of people may be out there saying ""My preventers don't work! Help!"" and while a small subset of those statements may be true, I suspect a good amount of people aren't practicing proper inhaler technique.

For instance Are you:

1. Using a mouthpiece spacer, instead of a face mask spacer? (those are much better and more effective, hence why its recommended you switch to it ASAP.)
2. Making a tight seal around the mouthpiece of the spacer?
3. Inhaling within 3-5 seconds completely after you press your inhaler?
4. Exhaling completely before you breathe in?
5. Taking a relative constant airflow, with a constant velocity when breathing in, rather than going too fast or too slow in the beginning? (If you struggle with this or point 3, I suggest you practice when you are free with your spacer, just without actually pressing the inhaler.
6. Making sure you hold your breath after you are done inhaling for as long as possible?
7. Washing your spacers every week?
8. Replacing your spacers annually?

Im sure there are more points that I may have forgot, but I strongly suggest you watch those ""How to use an inhaler with mouthpiece spacer"" videos on youtube. They were really helpful for me. I actually just recently made the switch from no spacer to mouthpiece spacer, and it took me a while to get all these points down, hence why I am making this post.",Asthma,"I think it is extremely important that people who are new to asthma practice proper inhaler and spacer technique.

27,"Hey, 26 female here. Been smoking for about 11 years. Quit cigarettes 8 days ago and not looking back. About 4 months ago I started having tightness in my chest followed by breathlessness when doing normal daily life activities. It almost came out of nowhere. Talked to my GP which gave me Salamol blue inhaler and told me to get help with anxiety. I did just as I was told. Started taking sertaline and inhaler. Inhaler doesn't relief my symptoms at all (I'm using it correct way with spacer). It feels like there's no space in my lungs. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse but the heaviness in my chest is constant 24/7. Sometimes I cough but there's no mucus although I wake up every morning with stuffed nose that goes away after leaving my bed. The breathing feels restricted both inhaling and exhaling, it's almost like there's no space to exhale and I need to force exhale which makes next breath even heavier. Last week went to urgent care as my throat and chest felt very tight but no wheezing. Oxygen levels are perfect, blood is good, no alpha 1 deficiency but doctor spotted hyperinflated lungs on x-ray. Told me it's probably COPD. That was 8 days ago. I'm crushed. Next day I felt even worse, went to urgent care again, another x-ray later another doctor tells me I don't have hyperinflated lungs and that my ribs are just small. Anxiety, he says. I threw my cigarettes away for life, but vape occasionally just to kill my withdrawals but will stop in a week or two. Currently I'm waiting for a spirometry test and cardiologist but it will probably take months and months of waiting. Everyday it feels like I'm breathless through a straw and have an elephant sitting on my chest. Waiting for diagnosis is killing me. Can someone relate to this?

It's been amazing so far, but this is the second inhaler I've gotten that's started to leak/spit out the white powder. The first time I happened I didn't know what to do, I had about 30 doses left... I didn't inhale much and rinsed my mouth out good, waited about 30 minutes to see if anything negative happened, then decided to put that one aside and get a fresh inhaler from the pharmacy. Well it's happened to me again now, nice big breath of choking powder with ~50 doses left. I can turn it upside down and shake, and a good quantity of the powder still shakes out in large-ish flakes. I only took one inhalation of that and immediately rinsed my mouth out good.

Does anyone know what's going on? I've tried looking it up but come up blank. I've been meaning to ask my pharmacist but keep forgetting (thanks ADHD). Can I keep using this one?

I have asthma too (according to my doctor when I was 7), but it's pretty mild. I have a light pain in my chest fairly constantly, my lung capacity is trash, and I get tired easily. I can't talk and walk at the same time; if I do it for too long, my breathing becomes super labored and audible. Phone calls while walking quickly are pretty much impossible; no one can understand what I say I'm between my huffing and wheezing. But I don't use any medications - I've had distinct asthma attacks maybe twice ever, and both times I just went outside and sat, and did some controlled breathing with fresh air. It hurt and I cried, but after a few minutes, I got myself back up and functioning.

But according to my husband, his asthma is much worse, and I just don't understand. He's able to exhale for much longer than I am, so I figured he must have great lung capacity? But he uses up his albuterol sulfate inhalers too quickly. With some irritants at home and a relatively sedentary l lifestyle (Covid - he was very active prior), he's using up an entire inhaler thing within two weeks, but he can only pick up refills once a month. So now with our current situation, he's trying so many things to supposedly help. ""Breathe easy"" tea, a canister of 95% oxygen to breathe from, a peppermint oil + menthol supplement. The tea didn't seem to help much last year, and the other two things mentioned haven't arrived yet, but he's also ordered other things to try.

I do most of our research and finances, so I'm trying to find a way to help him. **So I guess what I'm asking is actually two things - how can I understand my husband's asthma better, and how can I help him?**",Asthma,Trying to understand and help my husband with his asthma - help me help him please?,1626932686

16,"Greetings!

I would like to share the story of my health issues for the past 4 years. My problems started 4 years ago at age 38. I used to be a cigarette smoker earlier in life, not very heavy, and stopped completely by age 34 or so. However, I used to smoke cannabis almost every evening at that time and I think my current condition has something to do with it. It was always uncomfortable to smoke for my throat and lungs, however I never had any longer lasting issues at all. I used just a simple short pipe to smoke weed and later I have realized it was quite dirty as I wasn't very good about cleaning it at all. After one session, it felt somewhat worse that usual. The next day I started feeling some tightness and wheezing. This was going on for some time (I have significantly reduced my smoking as it didn't feel right), and after a few weeks I eventually caught a cold that developed into really bad bronchitis. And this bronchitis just would go away. Even after the worst of it subsided, I was still coughing up phlegm every 5 minutes or so. At this point I have stopped any smoking forever. Eventually I went to see a pulmonologist. My PFT was very good. I had an X-ray, later a CT as well and all allegedly looked good. I even had a bronchoscopy about a year after my first problems and all I was told is that my bronchis looked very irritated. I was tested for all kinds of disease like Valley fever but nothing. The diagnosis I got at some point was Reactive Airway Disease. After this first bout, it eventually subsided after almost a year. I felt great for about year and a half. I thought I was cured, but then in December 2019 I caught a cold again and developed the same symptoms all over again - chest pain and coughing up mucus constantly. I started to see a new pulmonologist, but really didn't like her take, she was quite dismissive of my issues and was claiming it is just allergies. My issues subsided after a few months and I felt a lot better, however, in September 2020 it started again, this time without a trigger of a cold or a acute respiratory disease. It is a bit different in that I have a lot less mucus and I don't really cough at all, just a constant chest tightness and chest congestion, scratchy chest and throat and some mucus in my throat as well. Wheezing and rattling at night. What's worse is that for last few months I have felt quite fatigued every day and have had almost constant headaches. Kind of like a low-key flu or cold feeling for months in addition to the chest problems. As far as prescriptions - I tried a lot of different inhalers - Flovent HFA, Symbicort, even Albuterol nebulizer - I feel like nothing was helping at all. Maybe the steroid inhalers were actually making me feel worse. Also I was prescribed Flonase and Montelukast. I don't really get short of breath at all, I can exercise and run just fine. It actually feels very good going for a hike in clean air, however it is very very hot in the summer where I live so there has not been much of that lately. I do not believe I have/had Covid at any point - I'm fully vaccinated since April and I have been isolating really well since March 2020 (I work from home and have been just around immediate family).

I kind of lost hope to get help from the doctors. I don't even have a real diagnosis after all these years. It feels like I have some kind of chronic bronchitis or COPD, but I still hope it is perhaps something less bad and potentially curable or manageable. Maybe adult onset asthma? The only diagnosis I ever got was Reactive Airway Disease which as I understand is kind of non-diagnosis. I'm really scared this will progress further and I'll start having some real breathing issues on top of present problems. I feel like crap every day and the fatigue/headache has been a real problem doing my day job as well lately. I would be very thankful if someone could give me some insight if they experienced similar symptoms or are familiar with cases like this or have any idea what this could be. Or how to find some real medical help (I live in Phoenix, Arizona area BTW). I'm kind of losing hope that I'll ever feel better again.

The initial coughs were deep, and then it just was dry heaving and vomiting. Doctors said my asthma (diagnosed May 2021) is bronchial, I'm on singulair 10mg, advair 2 puff twice daily, and a bunch of antihistamines.

I'm also possible mast cell disorder or some syndrome potentially caused by my newly diagnosed endometriosis (they think its severe and causing systemic inflammation).

The past couple days I’ve had a small cough and my chest has felt abit tighter than usual. Could this be my asthma starting up ? With covid going around I seen asthma and COVID both have the same symptoms but I’m not entirely sure on what all asthma symptoms are. Is coughing a symptom of asthma?
Thanks",Asthma,Asthma symptoms?,1626642188
34,"Hi There. I’m 35 F. I was diagnosed with asthma and allergies as a child, primarily exercise induced. My biggest symptom was coughing. When I was a young kid I would do nebulizers multiple times a day and also use a albuteral before physical activities. I also had sinus surgery at age six to enlarge the opening of my sinuses and enable them to drain better. This improved my life but I still have chronic sinus issues and year round allergies. I take zyrtec every day and have taken allergy medication daily since childhood. 

As I got older I “grew out of” the worst of it, but I continued to struggle with bad coughing any time I would get sick, and find exercise very hard to tolerate.  Today I have several albuteral inhalers around but don’t typically use them, even before exercise, because I forget to do it and I have a fairly sedentary lifestyle.  But at the height of COVID I realized that my asthma probably is affecting my life more than I realized when I found myself breathless at the top of one flight of stairs. I’ve never had what I would identify as a conventional “asthma attack” but I realized that I think my asthma does limit my daily activities somewhat and resolved to finally see a doctor about this and also my allergies and sinuses.

So I went to the doctor just over a month ago. I got signed up for allergy testing and am going to be starting immunotherapy next week for that. At first he didn’t seem concerned about my asthma but once I gave him more history he said he wanted to go ahead and test my lung function to make sure that they were in decent enough shape to handle allergy testing, since asthma often has an allergic trigger.  My lunch function came back close to 80% with the test they had me do in his office - I think some form of spirometry. He came in the room and said this is definitely asthma and although it isn’t super severe it isn’t normal either. 

He gave me enough samples of breo ellipta to try for the month and said we would re test at my follow up appointment. Well we didn’t re-test. He did ask me if I thought the inhaler had helped and I said it seemed like it because I was able to climb a different flight of stairs chasing after my kid and didn’t feel nearly so breathless a few weeks into taking the meds. So he prescribed breo ellipta to me. I discovered I can’t afford that medication when I went to get it, though, and so I didn’t fill it. 

I was planning to call him back to ask about switching to something with a generic, but before I could do that I got a message from the pharmacy that I had a new prescription for the Airduo Digihaler. Breo Ellipta is now showing as “discontinued”.  That was much more affordable so I did fill that one and have been taking it for like three days.

But the more I read about these medications the more I am not at all sure that this is appropriate for me. They seem to be helping my daily lung function but these combined steroids also seem to be recommended only for more severe cases?

36,"Hi, I wondered how people with asthma are dealing with working in an office these days.

I am 53 and have been working from home since March of last year.  Our unit was told we are going back 25% of the time next month.

I am concerned about going back as I have a chronic cough, especially in the early morning, and have been hassled about it before.  I get that it is annoying to others.  Aside from taking my medication and consulting my doctor if it is getting worse, I don’t have control over it.  I have allergies and work in an old building and my symptoms are worse at the office than at home.

I am fully vaccinated but I am concerned others might give me a hard time.

My boss is meeting with us individually this week to discuss our telework schedule.  I am willing to go back but if my presence is going to be a problem, I would like to ask if I can work from home as an ADA accommodation.

What are your experiences with asthma in the workplace?  I still have 14 years to go until I retire and don’t want to change jobs at this point as I have great benefits and am single.

Thanks for any help.",Asthma,Icy Chest,1626608675
38,"Hey guys. I've had asthma since I was a kid. I used to be constantly struggling to breathe growing up until about college. Then I started smoking once the asthma went away (weed mainly) and it came back full force. I have since quit (about two years smoke free).

For the first time in a while, I find it mostly controlled. My peak flows stay around 350-400, even when experiencing symptoms (slight chest tightness or a slight wheeze). It drops below that maybe once every month or two.

The issue is that I cannot handle the slightest symptoms. Minor wheezing (that does not impact my ability to breathe well) and minor chest tightness (that doesn't cause a dip in peak flow) bother me so much. Generally speaking, I'm sure I would be fine to just ride it out until my next maintenance dosage most of the time, but I enjoy feeling my lungs completely clear. I cannot concentrate or do anything with any symptoms present. This has led to me using my rescue inhaler once or twice daily to clear minor issues.

I am trying to lose weight and get my GERD under control to see if that will stop the minor issues each day, but otherwise, what can I do instead of using my rescue medication? I know that it is not good to use it daily. There are many days where I don't use it at all, but there are some weeks where I have to take one puff every day for some reason (usually after walking up stairs).

What are some ways I can relieve symptoms? I will likely discuss it with my doctor at my yearly (in a month) and see what he thinks. But I'd like ideas for now.",Asthma,How to Stop Using Rescue Inhaler Over Slight Symptoms?,1626589349

Lately, in the last couple of months, I’ve had new symptoms. I’ll eat a meal and about twenty minutes later I’ll fall into this coughing fit that gets so bad that I end up vomiting. Most of what I vomit is mucus. I’m not sure if it’s a certain food. I am suspecting that rice is somehow a culprit maybe? 

Afterwards I’ll drink some hot tea and feel better. But it’s been happening more and more often that I’m a bit concerned.

43,"When I was a kid I had what I'd consider mild to moderate asthma and used a maintenance inhaler (I think it was Advair) in addition to a rescue inhaler. I outgrew the need for an inhaler and my asthma only bothered me if I was around smoke or other heavy air pollution. Fast forward to now and I'm 29 and I've had a cough since March. At first it wasn't too bad, I just thought it was seasonal allergies, but it has persisted and gotten worse. Especially after showers I would end up on the floor gasping for breath or throwing up. My doctor tried a couple of allergy meds but nothing helped. I also got tested for Covid and that was negative (plus I'm fully vaccinated). So about a month ago it struck me that I have asthma. He seemed a little skeptical that after all these years I'd be having an asthma flare up but conceded to let me try an Albuterol inhaler 4 times a day for a weekend. It definitely helped significantly. No more collapsing or throwing up. When I reported back he agreed to give me Flovent as a maintenance inhaler. That's not going so well. I'm not collapsing but I'm still having these big gasping coughs where it feels like I'm taking my last breath before I cough. The Albuterol 4 times a day definitely helped more than Flovent twice a day. Anyway, I guess I'm just wondering if any of this sounds normal or about right for asthma and if I should push for him to try a different inhaler or go to a pulmonologist or what?

Before the appointment, I looked into the side effects of montelukast and found out that in some cases it causes depression. I felt that I had experiences a very low mood pretty often. I asked my doctor about the side effects, and she said that it can cause mood swings. This applied more to what I was feeling than depression did.

75,"Hi, I hope this isn’t breaking any rules (I haven’t found rules other than the ones that appear when I make a post)

Here’s some background for my questions:

I’m 21 years old and I’ve had asthma since birth. I also used to be really sickly as a kid, like caught the flu every year, got colds and fevers easily, etc. 

My attacks are mostly triggered by season changes, humidity(?) and hot weather (makes me feel like i’m suffocating), and I’ve also heard that I cough pretty bad in my sleep at times.

Anyways, at some point between 5th grade and 8th grade, my mom stopped “believing” that I have asthma (she’s still in denial to this day but it comes and goes). Every time I said I can’t breathe/used my inhaler in front of her she’d get mad and tell me that I don’t have anything. My sister joined in on it too as an opportunity to insult me and call me a faker.

This (is probably what) subconsciously led me to not use my inhaler like, ever, out of shame and feeling like I’m fishing for attention, or that everyone is looking at me and judging me — until I was around 20 years old. 

So my questions are these:
1. I’ve been using Symbicort for immediate relief recently, but I’ve noticed that whenever I use it, immediately (like a minute later) my heart starts racing and palpitating. It really incapacitates me in my daily life, so I can’t really go on like this. 

My question is has anyone else experienced this? Is this something that happens? If so, did you switch to another inhaler/did you find out why it happens?

I take Attent 20mg (it says mixed amphetamine salts) for ADHD each morning if it helps

2. Could the years that I’ve barely used my inhaler despite still having asthma worsened it? Or prevent my lungs from maturing well? I’ve recently heard that when left untreated asthma can lead to COPD and it really scared me 😓😞 

3. What does an “uncontrolled asthma” diagnosis mean? How can you tell if it’s uncontrolled? And what does uncontrolled mean in that context?

I know this isn’t an ask a doctor subreddit, but I really appreciate any answers possible.

79,"Hey everyone! Sorry for the long post, there’s a TL;DR at the end. 

I’m 24 F and for the past year I’ve been having this weird breathing thing. It’s similar to what some people have posted about but I wanted to detail exactly what’s going on &amp; hopefully get some advice. 

Starting around last July I started having trouble drawing a full breath. It isn’t necessarily hard or painful to breathe but it feels like I can’t reach the bottom of my lungs. Every few breaths will feel normal but the majority will be “stuck”. It’s like I have to yawn but can’t. It eventually passes but it can last hours to days. 

I’ve never had seasonal allergies before so I’m not sure but it could be related to that. It started last summer and I also had pretty bad post-nasal drip at the time. I had never experienced that either but it hasn’t been an issue since. 

The breathing issue got better but still happened occasionally until maybe a month or so ago when it started to become more noticeable again. I guess pollen is pretty bad where I live, we’re in a bad drought and it gets super dusty and windy. I have dry, itchy eyes sometimes but the breathing thing happens more often than other allergy-like symptoms. 

It seems to happen *regularly* but also *randomly.* Today it hit hard on my way home from an appointment, and I’ve been breathless and kinda lightheaded ever since. I spend a lot of time outside and it doesn’t ALWAYS happen.  I’m currently taking notes on when it does happen to see if it’s a pattern before I go to a doctor but I don’t have much yet. However, I have noticed that just in general I feel out of breath and tired over the last few days.

It’s not *painful* to breath but sometimes my heart/chest does feel kinda “heavy” and tight especially when I hit that point the air in my lungs stops and catches. I’ve had heart palpitations, gotten lightheaded easily, and have been terrible at running my whole life but just kinda assumed it was my own fault. 

I can road bike and do yoga just fine, I do a lot of hiking and tend to struggle with uphill but nothing crazy. However I can’t really hold a conversation while doing even just a light jog. So I do get out of breath way quicker and more intensely than a lot of people despite regular exercise.

**TL;DR: I regularly feel like I can’t take in a full breath for hours or days, but I don’t know what exactly it’s tied to.

96,"Hi. I’m 25 y.o. I’ve just been diagnosed with asthma for the first time. It’s so confusing and I’m anxious. 

I’ve been coughing for 8 damn months since I got COVID. I obviously visited doctors and they suspected the GERD (acid reflux) because my cough is getting much worse right after I eat anything. I got the therapy but it didn’t help. Doctors said they don’t know what else can trigger my cough then. Cause this is my only symptom along with feeling a lot of mucus/phlegm in my throat that never ever gets out no matter how hard I tried. It’s just there deep down all the time.

So I’ve been struggling all these months and today I went to another doctor and he said it’s probably asthma. I would never suggest it because it doesn’t fit to those asthma symptoms I googled. I don’t have shortness of breath, or wheezing, or dizziness, I don’t get up at night, I don’t feel like I can’t breath. I just have a stupid cough, that becomes worse after taking food, plus there’s mucus, plus the feel of tightness and tension in my chest. 

Anyway, I can’t believe I have this. What if the doc is wrong? Have you heard COVID triggering asthma in people who never ever had it or any other respiratory problems? This is so random and unexpected :(

What would you recommend to read about asthma? Any tips? What is the good a reliable source of info about it in English? Cause my country’s healthcare sucks and they have a lot of false information, our organisations don’t follow international standards or even WHO recommendations. Always creating our own ridiculous stuff with false guidelines.

Btw, the doc prescribed me Symbicort (budesonide + formoterol); Prednisolonum for 9 days god knows why; and Montelukast for 1-3 months…Is it fine? Cause our docs love to improvise with useless medication that are not recommended by anyone in the world, so I gotta check it…

97,"Hello everyone (back again),

I've been conducting an experiment across the last week after scoring no higher than 510 with [this Pinnacle PFM](https://www.numed.co.uk/products/pinnacle-peak-flow-meter). Being a fit 22-year old man with no breathing issues in my entire life, I thought this was odd - so I went and purchased [this Medi brand PFM from Boots](https://medicareplus.co.uk/product/medi-peak-flow-meter/). This one cost me considerably more than the Pinnacle PFM. Across the week, I score between 490 and 510 with the Pinnacle PFM. In contrast, I have scored anywhere from 580 to 620 with the Medi PFM. My technique does not change.

My question to the denizens of this subreddit is this: why in heck is this happening? To be absolutely thorough, I bought a second Pinnacle PFM and tested that to see if I had a faulty PFM. Nope. Same low results. Personally, the Pinnacle PFM seems far cheaper, less robust and less well-designed than the Medi PFM. The Medi one seems better designed, ergonomic and accurate. 

Looking at the two, I can see that the Pinnacle PFM has a detachable mouthpiece that slots on. The distance from the opening to the interior of the PFM would therefore seem to be greater than with the Medi PFM - which has a fixed mouthpiece and is one single unit. 

Any thoughts/opinions would be most welcome. I want to have as much ammunition as possible in case the military medical personnel come back and question my lower PFM results (which I had to submit). Thank you.",Asthma,Two Peak Flow Meters - Markedly Different Results - Why?,1626177979

14,"So, we \*think\* I have had asthma my entire life.  I just don't have normal symptoms like wheezing and coughing.  Just a long history of being sick \*a lot\*.  So I was only diagnosed a few years ago, and only put on maintenance inhalers about a year ago.  I try to ask questions with my drs, and google as needed, but I feel lost and like I know nothing about my condition or how it works.    


Lately, probably from the humidity and rain kicking crud up, I've been having more issues making it through the day without a rescue inhaler use, but I was \*mostly\* getting along ok, until July 2nd.  I got to work and our fryers were smoking...  My breathing started to suffer, but on top of this, I started to feel weak and kinda, idk, out of it.  I moved to a position in the back, used rescue, I saw after a bit that the smoke seemed to be in order, so I thought I was going to get through and be ok.  


Then some idiot decided they needed to start spraying oven cleaner.   I felt like I was going to faint.  I managed to tell a co that I had to leave right now, and basically just made it to my car and passed out for an hour.  When I was able to wake up enough I headed home, where I passed out for 5 more hours.  My mom sent my stepdad out to pound on the door about 3 hours in, and they were getting ready to call the police for a well check.  


I spent all weekend just using rescue, thinking I'd get better, and I didn't.   It hurt really bad to inhale, and I'd have some coughing fits as well.  Dr's were closed for the 4th so they got me in on Tuesday and started on steroids.  I was told I should be good to return today, but I went to wait for my son's bus and I already need my inhaler, and I'm just back to feeling like I can't inhale and a small cough here or there.  


So far, I'm super used to feeling like I can't inhale, like I'm suffocating.  My major symptoms during rough patches have only really been; I can't breathe, coughing fits, and spasms.  I actually had to explain my spasms to the hospital last time because they thought I was laughing, it was like, my diaphragm or something.   I can't remember anything like this though.  I passed out, fatigue has been pretty normal, but I like, crashed hard, and I've been on steroids since Tuesday and I'm only feeling a tiny bit better.  


I don't know what to do, or what's normal.  I've already been off work 10 days.  I guess any advice would be appreciated.  Is it normal to need a couple weeks or more?  

Last year I did have a really bad time where I was sick for over a month, but they'd thought it was strep, and didn't realize it was an URI until I wasn't getting better, it took a few rounds of steroids and an antibiotic before we got it all figured out.  This time I'm not sick, and I'm straight onto steroids, so Idk if I should compare them.  
I'm not sure if it's time to call the dr again.  Maybe I'm just in denial that I'm \*this\* bad, that an attack can throw me into a rut for weeks on end.  I am slightly better, so I'm showing progress I think, but I'm supposed to be good enough to get back to it, and I'm not.

21,";tldr constant breathlessness is making it impossible to school or work, but my doctors say it’s not my asthma causing it. What do I do? Does anyone know what else it could be?

Quick context: Back in 2018, I (23F) had a sudden attack out of nowhere and was subsequently diagnosed with asthma following a positive spirometry and methacholine challenge test. Before this attack, my only symptom was a persistent cough. Was given an inhaler and remained stable for two years with nothing but a cough. 

Fast forward to 2021: I feel awful. I’m constantly breathless and my chest is always tight and I can’t even eat or shower without getting out of breath. I’ve lost almost 10 pounds in three months because I can’t get through a meal without the breathlessness kicking in. My inhalers (Symbicort and Spiriva) aren’t helping. I’ve had to drop out of college because I can’t get through a day without feeling horribly breathless all the time. 

Despite all this, my tests are actually good. FEV1 is around 85%, chest X-Rays and CTs are clear, oxygen levels are fine. I had one round of Bronchial Thermoplasty done and during the endoscopy they found only minimal inflammation. The only test that’s coming up abnormal is a super high IgE reading. 

Because my tests have been largely good, one of my doctors has started to insist that my breathlessness is psychological. For context, I have a history of depression and anxiety back in my early teens, but have been in recovery for years now. I even checked with psychiatrist of 10 years for her opinion, and she insists my mental health is fine - I’m not having anxiety attacks or hyperventilating or anything. But my doctors are refusing to take my psychiatrist’s testimony into account. One is adamant it’s all in my head, the other just shrugs and says all she can do is increase my inhaler dose (tried it, didn’t work).

So what the heck do I do now? Does anyone have any experience with this? Would especially like to hear from someone who has comorbid conditions (COPD etc). What could this be if it’s not asthma?

Additional info: I’ve never smoked, and never had covid (my country is very safe, and I’ve repeatedly tested negative and have since been vaccinated).

I developed asthma at 10. It runs in my family on both sides I believe. I live in London where there’s a fair bit of pollution, and my house also has a mold problem. I was diagnosed at 13 due to doctors repeatedly telling me I was fine for 3 and a half years.

I developed epilepsy at 11. It runs in my dad’s family as well. I was diagnosed at 12 after having seizures left right and centre for months.

I would say that epilepsy is my ‘main’ (for lack of a better word) problem. Epilepsy can come with co-morbidities, like ADHD and autism. I have epilepsy, asthma and a heart murmur. My cousin has asthma, dyslexia and fortunately he outgrew his epilepsy.

40,"Since I started taking asthma inhalers 10 years ago, I've had a problem with oral thrush. As soon as it goes away it's back because my asthma inhaler - Sirdupla 25/250, is the cause. Even inhalers with less steroid still caused thrush - even the lowest one I was first prescribed. As luck would have it, I tried another that didn't cause thrush - Fostair, but then had a bad reaction  - to it - fast heart and itching (go figure :-( These are the things I've tried:

1) Spacer (clean it every week) - Helps but doesn't eliminate it

2) Washing mouth out after using inhaler - Helps but doesn't eliminate

3) Using Daktarin Oral Gel (helps, but it feels like I'm taking it constantly and comes back very quickly)

4) Brushing my tongue (once the tooth brush has been used for a week, it isn't as effective)

5) Using mouthwash - made it worse.

6) Reducing eating sugary food - helps but doesn't eliminate

7) Making sure I'm really relaxed when taking the medication so it predominantly stays in my lungs - helps but doesn't eliminate

8) Brushing my teeth before hand so my mouth is super clean  - helps but doesn't eliminate

9) Using Ventolin a lot (so not recommended as a solution, but when my asthma was bad and I was constantly taking this, my oral thrush basically disappeared which was amazing!)

10) Using Canesten Oral tablet because it works fast to eliminate thrush - but then it comes back just as quickly, because I have to take my inhaler every day.

I can't take probiotics because I'm dairy allergic. 

These are the solutions I was thinking of:

1) Buying a spacer for every day and only using it twice (morning and afternoon) and then washing it.

2) Changing my tooth products weekly.

My asthma is triggered by viruses and irritants like smoke and perfume. There’s a great big sign on my door saying no perfumes or cleaning products.

I talked to the charge nurse. She says it’s too hard to monitor everybody and “she’s aware of the complaint.” The replacement for this morning’s fragranced nurse asked me if I work from home, because I have to understand I canmt control people like this out in public - which is why I wonMt be out in public until I’m less brittle.

Its looks like this medication is perfect for fighting corona. There was recently a dutch article written about how remarkably few asthmatics end up in ic with corona. https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5193704/corona-astma-covid-19-risicopatienten-rivm-longartsen

""During the first wave, we have only seen one asthma patient in the ICU in our hospital, and during the second wave also one so far. That's relatively little when you see how common asthma is in the Netherlands,"" says Gert-Jan Braunstahl, a pulmonologist at Franciscus Gasthuis &amp; Vlietland in Rotterdam. He is considered the expert on asthma in the Netherlands.

He treats dozens of patients with (severe) asthma. Some 15 to 20 of his patients became infected with the coronavirus in the past six months. ""Two people had to be hospitalized, but in most of my asthma patients this corona infection had a mild course. They had mild symptoms like colds, headaches and feeling fluish.""

Other pulmonologists this picture as well. among pulmonologists there is a perception that asthmatics are relatively less often hospitalized because of corona,"" says Leon van den Toorn, president of the Dutch Association of Physicians for Pulmonary Diseases and Tuberculosis (NVALT).

And other countries are also drawing the same conclusions. ""Despite warnings that asthmatics would be at higher risk, they are underrepresented in death rates,"" the New York Times wrote in May. An earlier study published in medical journal The Lancet also showed this. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/coronavirus-asthma-risk.html#:~:text=Despite%20warnings%20that%20asthmatics%20were%

I got sick on Sunday. By Monday I felt like death, but was still able to sleep it off. Tuesday and Wednesday roll around and I can't go 2 minutes without a severe coughing attack. I'm taking *everything* I can think of to stop this cough.  Tessalon pearls, mucinex,  my rescue inhaler, hydrocodone (cause narcotics can ease coughs, right?

I manage to get in with my PCP Thursday, cause at this point I'm using my rescue inhaler every 2 hours (shame on me, I know).  My O2 was in the 80s when I was getting roomed, but I had just walked 10 feet like a normal person and hacked up a lung, but by the time my doc had come in it was back to like 98%. I tell her everything, including how I'm coughing so violently I'm vomiting, losing my voice, getting dizzy, having hot and cold flashes (no fever though) and can't say more than 4 words before coughing. I tell her I *know* this is cough variant asthma.

She listens to me reenact someone with TB dying of the plague, listens to my lungs (no wheezing), gets a chest x-ray (no pneumonia) an covid swab (negative).

It started in March, I was in urgent care one night and the ER the next day. I started seeing a pulmonologist/allergist in May. They ruled out allergies, changed my daily inhaler to Breo, and but me back on Singulair. I saw him again in June and was getting better, but he brought up me potentially having vocal cord dysfunction on top of my asthma. He said we would see how the next three months go and then potentially test me for it.

Then a few weeks ago I noticed that my voice was cracking a lot and was very raspy, along with constantly feeling discomfort in my throat. I messaged my pulmonologist and he said it's probably VCD and started me on Pepcid. 

Now I'm having the issue where I try to go to bed and I'm feeling a little short of breath. I only get a few hours of sleep in before I wake up each night not able to breathe.

A few months ago I had an attack, and now I use a preventer inhaler 2x daily and it seems like the asthma is relatively well-controlled unless I go near something triggering. But something that I find really upsetting is that I seem to start wheezing when doing exercise that increases my heart rate significantly like rock climbing. I went climbing today after months of not climbing, and I felt really good at first, until I started having a wheeze. I took my reliever inhaler and stopped climbing, it took about half an hour to feel pretty normal again. I did take 2 puffs of my reliever inhaler before climbing as well but the wheezing still happened. I did go biking yesterday without taking a reliever before and I was totally ok, but I was more careful while biking to not get my heart rate too high. My heart was pumping hard while I was climbing, and I didn’t notice how hard it was pumping until I started wheezing. 

So my question is first of all, is this normal to wheeze even after a reliever prior to exercise if it’s an exercise you haven’t done in a while, or should I be concerned about this?

73,"Hello everyone,

I am writing here to hear your opinions and experiences on living with asthma.

First, I would like to tell you my history and how I am diagnosed: Around 10 years ago, I needed a chest x-ray for an official document and my doctor told me I should visit pulmonologist after seeing the x-rays because there is a problem on my right lung. I've just ignore his warnings until a month ago and decided to give a visit to a specialist. He asked for another x-ray and after that to be sure the pulmonary function test. After I failed on the test he suggested that I should buy a peak flow meter and record the measuring. So I did what he asked for, at first I was getting 200 L/min until I learn how to blow then my recordings were around 350 L/min. When I showed the table of my recordings, he said they are not good and prescribe me a inhaler (Foster) and said that I should use it and see if there is any change such as before exercise. I use it and didn't notice any change. Either I do not know how is normal breathing or it does't helping me or my asthma is not that severe.

And now I will explain why I am here to ask your help, as a scientist I love to find the bottom of the problem. I live without any problem related to my breathing until now.  Yes maybe I was always puffed after climbing the stairs or after a run but hey I am not an active person and it might be the reason. When I was 9, I got very pneumonia but it was treated well. Side note to that, when I was reading old medical books from 90s to learn more about asthma and lung diseases, I found interesting fact: a small red rash appear under right eye is a sign of pneumonia. I've always had this rash. When I consult to a dermatologist about it, they always said it is because of stress. I do not have any one in my family with an asthma so I have to eliminate genetic factors. My mom was a cleaning addict, which I now in some cases can be the reason of child asthma. Plus one of the student flats I've lived had a mold problem, which is very recent though. Other than the ones I wrote here I can't think any other reason for my asthma. It would be very nice to hear your opinions.

75,"Hi,

I would like to share my story about experience with covid19 and asthma.

 It started out that I was a normal healthy person who had never had asthma and no one in the family had ever had hereditary asthma. Then I got covid in 2020 about May it was symptoms of intestinal flu which lasted 8 days with it also unbearable headaches. After the symptoms disappeared, I started to breathe harder and I experienced asthma attacks. I went to an allergist and I was prescribed Dasselt 5mg and he gave me ventolin, the symptoms improved a bit but it was terrible when I exercised so it happened that I had an asthma attack the same morning or at bedtime.

 I was recently vaccinated with the first dose of pfizer it's been 5 weeks and the asthma symptoms have disappeared, I've discontinued allergy medications and I'm back in normal life as before.

My allergy doc just informed me that the discolored spot is actually a delayed allergic reaction, and to prepare for the second dose with a litany of prednisone.... and I'm not sure how I feel about that.

79,"Hey all, this ended up a bit longer than I intended.

  
So let me start off by saying I’m in my late twenties with history of smoking cigarettes (quit 5 years ago), smoking cannabis (quit when I started having symptoms) and a family history of asthma. Last year on October 2nd, I started experiencing incredibly sudden shortness of breath, fast heart rate, sweating, tiredness, brain fog, and a bit of nausea. It happened in the evening as I was washing a few pots and pans by hand. it lasted all into the next day, and from there on out about 2.5 weeks. it was very scary and I had never experienced anything like it. I continued to have these shortness of breath symptoms for weeks at a time (minus the sweating and nausea) with maybe a week break in between where I felt “normal.” I have never had a day like I did on October 2nd, so while I’m happy about that, I still can’t breathe like I used to.

Fast forward to this year, I got a diagnosis of asthma even though my breathing tests were fairly ok (I mainly attribute that to having a good breathing day where I could breathe well that day). I don’t wheeze, I don’t cough. I just cannot take deep breaths for hours, sometimes days at a time. I also yawn excessively during these episodes. Sleeping will give me temporary relief but a lot of the time my shortness of breath will come back within the hour of waking up. Sometimes it will be the same as it was before I slept, sometimes it will be a bit better. 

i have suspected GERD and am on medication for that. I am also taking Albuterol inhaler. i recently became pregnant and so my pulmonologist switched me from Breo back to Flovent and I am back to being miserable. I used to only have episodes two to three days a month while on Breo but they were never awful. 

Since switching back to Flovent twice a day, Im having more frequent shortness of breath. I feel like Flovent does not work well with me but my pulmonologist said he was taking me off of Breo because there is no research on taking it while pregnant. He did however mention that if the benefits outweigh the risks he would put me back on Breo, but the risks are unknown? I have no idea. I’m going to message him again asking what the risks are but it makes me nervous going back to a medication he took me off of because in the message he wrote to me he specifically said it was unsafe for pregnancy.

This kind of turned into a bit of a vent, sorry about that. I’m just wondering if anyone had very sudden symptoms randomly one day with absolute zero warning like I did. Lots of healthcare professionals have tried brushing this off as anxiety since I used to be on anxiety medication because of post-partum anxiety, but I haven’t felt anxious in a few years and I have a pretty stress free life.",Asthma,Sudden asthma,1625619606

26,"My first post on here, and sorry it’s a long one. I’m a 28 y/o Male, and I’ve suffered with asthma for most of my life. I am also a sufferer of hay fever and have noticed, especially this year, my hay fever has been very bad (I live in the UK).
Last weekend, I noticed that I started to develop a tight chest. It then started to develop into a almost “pounding sensation/flutters” as if I could feel my heart beat across my chest/shoulders, and my breathing felt just a little bit laboured. I’ve had these symptoms, on and off, since Saturday. I’ve had no pain and it hasn’t stopped or prevented me from working or go about my daily routine. But I’m just slightly concerned as to whether asthma/hay fever can cause this?

Back in October last year, I stopped using both my Seretide and Salbutamol completely, as my asthma has always been very well controlled and has never caused me any really problems. When I’ve had my asthma checks annually, I have always been told my asthma is almost non-existent and extremely well managed.
However, I’ve found since Saturday I’ve been taking my inhalers to combat these symptoms which I believe could be more prominent due to my hay fever being quite severe this year; normally my hay fever is fairly minimal.

I’ve spoken to my GP about my symptoms and he didn’t see any real concern and believes it could be asthma related. However, I’m just a bit anxious as to why I developed these symptoms suddenly and why it has been so prolonged? I do notice a difference when I take my inhalers (which I am now doing twice daily, with both my Seretide and Salbutamol). I’ve also suffered with anxiety/panic attacks in the past and since these symptoms started, I have felt quite on edge. I suppose I’m just after a bit of clarification that I’m not the only person who has found their asthma flare up this year/Summer and that the symptoms I’m experiencing are maybe asthma and anxiety related?

Sometimes during a work out it feels like there's a noticeable (but manageable) bit of obstruction in my breathing - not quite full on wheezing (and that's even with the rescue inhaler 20/30 minutes earlier).

I wonder is it my overall asthma condition, or something completely different. Right now I do HIIT on the indoor bike every other day for 30 minutes, and maybe swap in a 4-5K on road a few times a month. (and just to be clear I think my performance is way below my peers, like bottom 10% after doing this for a few years)

For those of you with regular cardio routines/sports, do you feel your medicated asthma is 100% a non-issue, or does it still impact your performance in some way? It's like the rescue medication keeps me from wheezing, but after that baseline is reached there's still a range of breathing performance where I may have a ways to go. 

TLDR: I'm not as good as I think I should be on the exercise bike. Could it be my ""controlled"" asthma and are there other actions to help besides the pretreatment with rescue inhaler?",Asthma,expectations for asthmatics' fitness performance,1625230796
29,"I’m going to go my doctor of course.

To start with I’m not diagnosed with asthma, and I’ve never been assessed for it, however I have wondered if I have it for most of my life.

I had an in home sleep study last night and one of the pieces of equipment was a pulse oximeter , an expensive medical grade one ($1000 when I looked it up) so it’s accurate.

I noticed that my o2 saturation hovered around 92-93% most of the time I was awake and was a bit alarmed when I read that this is kind of considered a cut off for hypoxia and definitely not normal.

I never feel I can take a satisfying breath, and I often have to lie down to breathe properly and feel dizzy. However I’ve never been GASPING for breath so I thought that excluded asthma. It doesn’t feel like an emergency I just have to sit down after exercise and I can’t catch my breath ever which can make me really anxious and foggy too.
 
I have to split up my sentences to get my breath and I’ve only recently realised that I do this. I sigh a lot and yawn a lot and I’m always tired (hence why I got a sleep study). The weirdest thing is when I woke up and looked at the monitor it was 97, but within minutes it had gone down to 92-93 range again. 

I’ve ALWAYS felt like I need to sleep to get my breath back but I don’t understand why. When I’m awake I do stop breathing sometimes subconsciously so I wonder if it’s related. I also yawn and sigh all the time. Lying down didn’t increase my o2 but sleep did.

Could my breathing be dysfunctional and I’m hypoventilating? I’ve never heard of that though 

Sorry if wrong sub couldn’t find a general one about breathing and I’m wanting to get to the bottom of this.",Asthma,Does this sound like something to look into?,1625222781
30,"Hey everyone,

My first (and likely only) post on here, as I was given instructions by my doctor to use the [asthma.org.uk](https://asthma.org.uk) guide regarding the peak flow diary I have to fill in. I am doing so as part of a military medical procedure. It has to be done for 7 days. Note I've had no problems with cardio or running in the past, and exercise regularly. My brother had childhood asthma but I have had no such problems at any point in my life. I have also done the Wim Hof Method on and off for the past few years, so I thought my lung capacity was pretty solid. I'm never out of breath, wheezy or cough a lot.

This was until I checked out what the 'normal' score for a 22 year-old male is supposed to be - at the 560-570 mark. I'm 60-70 away from that, and this has me worried for my future career in the armed forces. I'm not sure if my lungs are under-capacity for someone my age and if this could be a problem for my application, or if I'm just using the peak flow meter wrong and screwing up the technique, or if my lung capacity has gone down a bit since I haven't done the Wim Hof Method in about a year.

I'm talking wheezing, coughing, metallic taste, chest pains, etc. when I would run or jog just a quarter mile. My doctor wanted me to see a specialist before talking about an inhaler but since I was overweight at the time it was more or less dismissed right there as an out of shape issue.

Got covid last year and my suspected asthma got a lot worse so my doctor caved and prescribed me an albuterol inhaler. 

Since then, I've competed Couch to 5K and have run multiple complete 5Ks with taking two puffs before exercise. My most recent 5K run last week had an average pace of 10:30 per mile. With only 30 doses left of my inhaler, I've been thinking about going off of it since I am doing so well. Never mind that I've never ran without using it beforehand.

Then came about an hour ago. Got out of class and got a weather alert that it was going to torrentially rain in about 10 minutes. To takes me 15-20 minutes to walk the two-thirds of a mile back to my place so I thought I could run it and make it before it rained. My inhaler was not with me.

Well, less than 2-3 minutes of jogging, my throat was so sore and my chest hurt. My breathing sounded so awful and raspy. I had to stop to catch my breath and I just wheezed for a solid 30 seconds. Then I speed walked for a minute or two and heard a thunderclap. Attempted to run again. This time it took me 2 minutes to feel like I was breathing through a straw. Switched to speed walking. Then I felt some rain starting to come down. Decided to give it another go and made the light to cross the intersection. At this point, my throat and chest hurt so bad and my legs were trembling...*from like 2 minutes of running/jogging with walks inbetween* As I said, I literally ran a 5K was a good time last week and could have ran further no problem. 

Then it started to downpour so I just full speed ran to my place less than two blocks away. I was getting lightheaded and my breathing was atrocious sounding. Finally got to my building's lobby and was kneeling over to catch my breath for a solid 2 minutes.

That was an hour ago. My throat and chest still hurts/are sore. I coughed up a fair bit of phlegm.

I walk an hour a day, try to get more intensive exercise but it is very difficult for me to over exert because I have a rare neuromuscular condition that causes periodic paralysis (basically all day) and if I work out too hard it can put me out for a day or two totally.

Sent me home with a rescue inhaler and told me to use it before exercise and when needed.  I tried this.  It never helped.  I used a spacer, I tried doing more than the 2 puffs.  Everything.  The inhaler never once helped me.  So I learned to work around my breathing issues.  I quit playing team sports and stuck to biking and swimming, where I could stop and not worry about letting others down.  I have never once ever had breathing issues outside of exercise.  And I grew up in wild fire county, with cats, and every other allergen you can think of.  This isn't actually the issue, but I thought I'd include it as maybe it's meaningful. Maybe I have exercise induced asthma, maybe I don't.  I'm less concerned about that as it's something I've managed and more concerned with the following:

14 months ago, I started noticing that my breathing felt weird.  It was uncomfortable, or labored.  It just wasn't right.  Felt like I was breathing gas.  It slowly got worse.  Doctor took one look at me and said ""asthma.""  Sent me home with symbicort.  Which I tried for a couple weeks, but it made me cough so much and my symptoms got worse while on it.  So I stopped.  I tried alvesco for a month.  Zero improvement.  It just kept slowly getting worse. At first it was only at night.  Now it's 24/7.  I literally never feel normal.  It gets worse at night.  The ONLY thing that gives me any sort of relief, is a steamy shower.  And even then, it doesn't go away, it just doesn't feel as bad.  I feel a tightness in my chest sometimes as well.  It kind of feels like I'm breathing through a filter.  Like I can get the air in, it just doesn't feel smooth and easy.  I had a spirometry test.  It showed ""mild obstruction.""  I've had two scopes at the ENT, an endoscopy, a 24hr ph montitor, and a stress test.  Everything is normal.

I was also given 5 days of prednisone as an ""just in case."" But never actually told to take it.  I don't want to take prednisone unless it really seems like I have asthma and need it.

I'd be fine to accept an asthma diagnosis, but here are my issues that make me question that.  

1. This feeling came on over night (and slowly has worsened).  I know the exact date.  It was very noticeable.
2. I've never had breathing issues outside of exercise,
3. Inhalers have not helped and even have made things worse.
5. I don't wheeze, and rarely cough.
6. I've had a persistent sore throat for 10 months.

I thought I'd ask some people who suffer from asthma regularly if this seems like asthma? It doesn't feel the same as when I can't breathe during exercise.  I've been slowly getting worse for 14 months and now breathing is constantly uncomfortable.  Which puts me in the category that doctors like to ignore.  I'm not urgent enough for them to worry about, but I'm miserable.

Thoughts?

22,"So, a little bit of history. As i kid, i would very often get bronchitis. I would have dust allergies all the time. Cetrizine and loratadine were my go-to, in addition to antibiotics. As I grew up, i pretty much became better in this regard. I’m 25 now and I usually take anti-histamines only like maybe 5-6 times a year (maybe for a couple of days when it gets bad). 

In the last 5 years, i would go for occasional runs and at a time i could even run upto 4km non-stop. (It’s not great but whatever). 


All through last year, i barely did any cardio. Owing to the pandemic, i kept myself indoors, and the little exercise i did were pushups. 

I started going for runs again, and i find myself in a very bad condition. Idk if it’s anything serious, or just a lack of fitness.  My chest starts burning after like 0.75km of running. My legs have not given in at all. It’s my lungs that’s the bottleneck. I ran 1.5km yesterday, and my chest still feels a bit tight right now. I had a bit of mucus and coughs after running, but that subsided immediately.

23,"40-something, asthmatic since infancy, severely asthmatic as a kid but well-controlled with meds and environmental controls for the last decade (since identifying many food triggers). 

I am severely lactose-intolerant and have a milk allergy. Even trace amounts of lactose in medications will trigger a serious reaction. While this allergy was easily manageable for a long time, about 6 years ago it became so severe that I absolutely can’t take meds with lactose any more. 

I’ve been taking montelukast for about a decade, in addition to a cocktail of other meds (symbicort, nasonex, Allegra, plus Benadryl most evenings, and occasionally sudafed). However, most formulations of montelukast (including the name brand) contain lactose. Once I discovered the worsening milk allergy, I switched to a manufacturer that doesn’t use lactose (kremer, which now markets under the name Lannett). My doctor writes the exact NDC on the scripts so there’s no mixups. 

Apparently Lannett is stopping production of their montelukast (I don’t yet know if this is temporary or permanent) so the 3 month script I just filled may be my last. 

I can’t find any manufacturers who don’t use lactose. I don’t know if any exist any more. 

Has anyone been in a similar position where they had to quit montelukast for some reason even though it works well? Seems like all the alternatives are the same meds I’m already taking but I’m out of the loop (the blissful ignorance of controlled asthma, after 3 decades of uncontrolled asthma!), and wondered if there’s anything else out there. 

Not really interested in biologics at this time, but not opposed to hearing more, either.

I know I had to do tests when I was younger because I had used a nebulizer for years and once it became more manageable we switched to an inhaler. 

My one doctor tried to put on me on Advair when I was in middle school but I had a horrible reaction and stayed on the inhaler only. And this has worked out well for me since then. I only need my inhaler for allergy season, the cold weather (because I can get a cold that’ll turn into bronchitis real quick), and before a hard workout - so I’m not using it daily. 

I recently got a new PCP and while she was taking my history she asked about my asthma. And I felt like she didn’t believe me that I was asthmatic because she wants me to get a PFT done. She said it’s to determine how my asthma is now and whether or not I need the inhaler I’ve been using (which is albuterol). I feel a little uneasy about this because it’s not like I use my inhaler every day but I will still have moments when I just wheeze.

But i never had any issues with breathing or anything with what im experiencing now, 

According to the lung dr they say it just looks fine how it is now, but i still have moments where it feels like im having a hard time breathing, fast breathing, and a weird feeling i cant put in words. Like everything is rushed, feels like i dont get enough air, and cant inhale deep enough,  its really scary at times. 

And again, theres probably more but i dont remember at times how i felt at that moment, 20 minutes ago i felt really bad with breathing again that i used ventolin and now it feels a bit better tho, feels like if i move my leg fast it helps breathing aswell?

[Asthma](https://www.millioninsights.com/industry-reports/asthma-market?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sunilR_17June21) is a lung disease; i.e. a chronic condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the bronchial tube (the passageways that permit air to pass in and leave the lungs). Some of the symptoms of asthma include shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing and chest tightness. The factors that propel the Asthma Market size include innovation in drugs, rising occurrences of asthma cases, mounting geriatric population, rising number of smokers, growth in the disposable income, developing healthcare infrastructure and facilities, and intensifying pollution level.

On the other hand, there are also factors that hinder the global Asthma Market size such as the patent expiry of drugs, high expenditure on treatment, and growth in use of generic drugs. The global Asthma Market size spans type, device type, drug type, route of administration, and geography. On the basis of type, the global Asthma Market size constitutes allergic asthma and non-allergic asthma. The allergic asthma is basically caused due to exposure to allergens like pollens from weeds, trees, etc., dust, and so on. On the other hand, the non-allergic asthma is basically caused due to exercise, stress, cold, flu, etc.

On the basis of device type, the global Asthma Market size constitutes inhalers and nebulizers. The “inhalers” segment is further sub-categorized as dry powder, soft mist inhalers (SMIs), metered dose inhalers (MDIs). Nebulizers are devices that carry the drug in a fluid form that is dispensed by the compressed air. The “nebulizers” segment is further sub-categorized as mesh nebulizers, compressor nebulizers, and ultrasonic nebulizers. In 2015, the metered dose inhalers (MDIs) accounted for the largest share of the global Asthma Market owing to the ease of availability, consistency, portability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.

The features like portability, noteworthy benefits in the home healthcare applications, and ideal design that enables dispense medication directly to the respiratory track are estimated to offer prospective growth opportunities for its high utility.  On the basis of drug type, the global Asthma Market size spans anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, bronchodilators, mast cell stabilizers, leukotriene antagonists, and combination of ICS/LABA. In this segmentation, the combination drug type consisting of inhaled corticosteroids with long-acting beta agonists dominated the global Asthma Market in 2015. The factors that attribute to the large share of combination drug type are rise in application rates due to twofold action of combination therapy and its high efficacy rate.

On the basis of route of administration, the global Asthma Market size spans inhaled, oral, intravenous, and subcutaneous. The inhaled route of administration accounted for the largest market share of the Asthma Market in 2015.  On the basis of geography, the global Asthma Market size constitutes North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Rest of the World. North America holds the largest share of the global Asthma Market due to rising number of asthma patients, increase in geriatric population, drug innovation, high-tech advancement, and developed healthcare infrastructure. The North American market is tracked by Europe. During the forecast period, the Asia Pacific’s market is projected to witness a high growth rate owing to factors such as rise in population, increasing number of asthma patients, emerging healthcare infrastructure and facilities, environmental pollution, growing disposable income, and enlarging number of smokers.

Some of the prominent players that fuel the growth of the Asthma Market include AstraZeneca Plc, Philips Healthcare, 3M Health Care, Allied Healthcare Products Inc., Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Novartis AG, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., GF Healthcare Products, Smith Medicals, Lincare Holdings Inc., and Baxter International.",Asthma,"Asthma Market Growth, Increasing Demand, End User, Regional Trends &amp; Forecast To 2025",1623917430

i have always had super severe allergies. i was always ""that kid"", snotty, drooly, sneezing. 
even in my adult life i'm still very allergic. triggered mainly by like outside stuff and my cats. i take just normal zyrtec as needed but oh my gosh let me tell you what happened. 
yesterday was fine, normal. my cats have been sneezing (which is cute but sad for them, just normal cold theyre fine) and i was comforting one of them being all over them kissing them etc.

Unfortunately the rescue inhaler does nothing at all to relieve my symptoms and I have noticed no difference in my condition on Advair either. My doctor then gave me a 5 day course of 40 mg prednisone and the only thing I felt on that was insomnia, didn't notice any difference in my breathing condition.

82,"It's been an interesting couple of days in the world of my asthma. Sunday I was up in Maine, we were going to work on a piece of property up there. We stop at a local hardware store to get some tools. Well, right as I hop out of the car and walk in front of it, I notice a worker smoking a cigarette *right there*. Cigarette smoke specifically is my biggest asthma trigger; it messes me up for literally days. So, as my family goes in and gets what we need to get, there I am sitting on the back of the car, taking my inhaler, drinking water, chewing on mint gum (helps for some reason), coughing up a lung as everyone is staring at me. Nothing to see here folks, just dying at the hands of this random lady who works for this random local hardware store.

Anyways. We went home Sunday night as scheduled, I continued to die. Yesterday, Monday, I went to school. In the morning I'd been... better, kinda. Not coughing nearly as much. Most people around me in school realize I have asthma and are used to me coughing some, just not this much. Because I was feeling better, I actually tried while we were playing baseball in second period, gym class. I must say, being someone not terribly athletic I did better than I ever usually do, and I was really trying and very proud of myself. Well, sprinting to a home run while having messed up asthma was not a terrific idea, as I soon learned. Third period, history, I'm sitting there and just can't stop coughing. The main issue being that none of my coughs are substantial, like you know how you get a good cough where you can feel yourself clearing up a little, this was not that. Eventually, I ask to go to the nurse, no explanation needed because at this point everyone has figured out that ""hey that kid in the back corner is freaking dying"". Go to the nurse, they don't have my inhaler. See, I realized this, but typically I don't need to use my inhaler so I've never bothered to give one to the nurse since this is my first year at this school and I haven't needed it. Well, yesterday I learned I actually am allowed to self-medicate. Would have been nice to know while I was packing my bag at home, inhaler right there. So anyways, nurse's assistant knows I have asthma, I'm able to get enough words in to express that I encountered smoke and was pretty much just messed up from that. No other symptoms of covid, and she confirmed that. Then the actual nurse comes in. She starts just going off about ""why did you come to school today,"" ""you don't know it isn't covid,"" ""then why do you have that bad of a cough."" She's being pretty loud and just talking over me while I'm trying to explain that **yeah lady I walked through cigarette smoke and promptly forgot how to breathe, this is a routine thing that has always happened to me even before covid**. But, of course, this is between coughs, voice is mildly dead, so I can't talk loud, so she just ignores me. Eventually I finally get through to her, then they just stick me in a bed in the very back and ignore me for a half hour while my parents come to get me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, some main takeaways from my story:

1. Make sure nobody's smoking when I get out of the car
2. Maybe don't sprint for the home run while having issues with asthma
3. Bring my inhaler places
4. Don't bother wasting my ever-fleeting breath to explain things to the school nurse because she doesn't listen.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Walked through cigarette smoke, asthma attack, went to school next day, sprinted in PE class, died more, went to nurse, nurse didn't half care, didn't bring my inhaler, went home early, asthma sucks.**",Asthma,"Smoke, ""its not covid,"" and PE class.",1623777299

5,"Hi so I have asthma, I was diagnosed in January after consistent episodes of breathing difficulty and multiple chest infections in 2020. Recently I was given Soprabec steroid inhaler, to be taken 2 puffs in morning and 2 in evening, after I had an asthma attack whilst working at the bar in the pub. I'm still stumped as to what happened, one minute I'm serving whiskey to three of our regulars who were the only ones indoors, the next I'm coughing uncontrollably, my coworker said my lips were going blue (absolutely terrified her as well) and I felt like I couldn't catch the next breath - it was my first serious asthma attack and scared the absolute shit out of me. Luckily I managed to get my spacer and I was able to stop it without going to hospital, and got sent home by my boss - I got an emergency asthma appointment a few days later (as my attack was at the weekend and the GP was closed) and the asthma nurse gave me Soprabec. She warned me it could make me cough and could make me gain weight but didn't mention anything about fatigue or irritation. I've been taking it as prescribed and been doing everything I've been told since Tuesday evening when I got the inhaler but my god, I feel like my brain has been tampered with or I've been possessed by some weird spirit.

I normally work from 4:30 maybe 5 until 11 at night, 4 days a week, the pub where I work is a literal 3 min walk down the hill from my house. This week I've only worked 1 shift since starting the steroids and I was really tired during it, more than usual. I go to bed pretty much straight after I get home (11:15-11:30) because it's physically quite demanding, and I get up around 7:30-8, sometimes I take my brother to school at 8:30 (short drive). If I haven't been at work, I usually go to sleep at 10:45-11:00. However since starting the steroids I've got up in the morning, maybe done the school run, played with my cat/read a book, had lunch because I'm bloody starving, and then fallen asleep on the sofa watching Netflix because I'm so damn tired. I have my first covid vaccine tomorrow (there was an admin error so it's 8 weeks late!) and I'm kinda worried the fatigue will get even worse. The tiredness comes in waves and luckily there are points where I don't feel completely run down and exhausted but there's other times I'm sat on the sofa struggling to keep my eyes open. I'm basically dead once I've finished eating lunch around 12:30.

Has anyone else had this issue, on Soprabec or any other steroids? And if you have, was it temporary???? I feel that maybe the asthma nurse would have mentioned if I would feel like I've been run over by a train by midday. I'm sort of worried that if I'm still on steroids by September it will interfere with my university work and everything else I do when I'm at uni. I am quitting my job at the pub for multiple reasons - partly because the smoking area makes my asthma bad but also because my boss doesn't give a crap about covid rules - but am applying to work in other places and want to be able to bring my A game to the job without feeling like I'm gonna fall into a coma afterwards.",Asthma,Soprabec preventer inhaler (Beclometasone) making me extremely tired???,1623535058

About me: Lifetime mild-moderate asthma, had covid in March 2021 (mild, no attacks to resp. system), Pfizer vaccine &gt;2 weeks ago. Based in Toronto. I'm on Breo which I take every other day, and take 10mg Loratadine daily. 

I'm a moderate runner, try to run 2-3 times per week. I did have a 1 month hiatus after recovering from covid, and have now resumed for 3 weeks. Before my break, I was running between 5-10km comfortably, no stops. 

Now, I can't even get through a 5k with stopping multiple times. I take my inhaler before running as a preventative measure, and then end up taking it again mid-run because I start to wheeze. Even when my lungs feel 'clear', I just don't feel like I'm getting enough air. 

I know pollen levels have been astronomical this year. Anyone else feeling like this lately? Could it be covid, or the vaccine? I'm thinking of booking a Dr's appt just to see if there's anything I might be ruling out.

But my FeNo test was so low, and I haven’t had a spirometry test since I was a kid. A lung xray a year ago showed mild pneumonia (from covid) and signs of moderate to severe asthma.

I started smoking cigarettes when I was 12, I finally quit when I was 27. I smoked probably 2-10 cigarettes a day for most of that time. For the past few years I have had a persistent cough, it happens virtually every morning. I wake up and start coughing violently to the point I can't breathe. Nothing comes up, it doesn't really hurt, and it stops after about a minute. Sometimes it can happen during the day but it seems pretty random and it's hard for me to pinpoint a trigger. I honestly just accepted this and when I do it in front of others they ask if I'm okay because it's so violent. I try to breathe in but every time I do I cough harder and harder until there's no air in my lungs. But then it's over and I'm fine.


I am also an avid hiker. I have been doing it for years. This summer I plan on starting my mission to become a 46er in NY (hiking the 46 tallest mountains in NY state). I hike frequently and typically have no issues, but if I exert myself (especially up a steep incline) to a point where I have to breathe harder, I start to become unable to catch my breath. I have to stop and take a break while I try to catch my breath. My boyfriend tells me to breathe deeper, slower breaths through my nose and it makes me really frustrated because I literally can't breathe slower or deeper in that moment. I don't feel physically tired during these times either, I just feel like I am not getting enough oxygen. I have gotten dizzy during these episodes as well. I always thought this was due to me being out of shape but I exercise pretty often, walking at least a mile a day, on my feet all day at work, I do yoga, and other outdoor activities as well. 

It feels like I have tiny lungs that can't support my body when it needs a lot of oxygen really fast. I joke with my boyfriend that I have ""baby lungs"" due to smoking so young. I feel like my ability to breathe deeply is below average for someone my age.

This whole thing is really embarrassing and frustrating because I feel like I can hike for 10+ miles easily without getting physically tired.

While the mucus isn't super new (having started a few months ago too) it's become a daily (sometimes multiple times a day) thing in the last month. And it comes up mostly in hour long coughing fits.

When these symptoms first started getting bad, I went to urgent care, got a very quick check up and was given antibiotics for possible bronchitis... I didn't take the antibiotics (I know, I know). The symptoms were annoying but manageable, especially the mucus which only happened for very short periods (I really didn't even think it was an actual problem). Months passed and it got a little worse and worse until May 2nd, when it started becoming a daily thing. 

I don't know how much mucus plays a part in asthma, if any. But even if it does, I've never had it this bad, never had it colored or everyday. The only other time I've had asthma symptoms everyday was last year for a few weeks but I went to the ER and was cleared. The only reason I'm wondering if there's a correlation is because the mucus mostly comes up after asthma meds. Should I be more concerned about this? Right now its more of an annoyance but I have taken notice in the increase of symptoms. Are there other things I should be looking for, taking note of? Has anyone else experienced this? It's becoming a bigger part of my day than I ever thought it would so I'm curious, naturally.

55,"Hello all,

I have had mild asthma my whole life, and never really used my inhalers and just dealt with the problems. The last couple months it has gotten really bad and my doctor put me back on Flovent. I have been using it twice a day for about the last three weeks. My asthma problems have improved dramatically but I have had pretty bad sinus issues (sneezing, runny nose, coughing, mild headaches, and watery eyes) for about 8 days now. I don't really feel weak, have low energy or have a high temperature like a typical cold would. I am starting to wonder if potentially it is the new Flovent inhaler causing the sinus issues...

56,"Are there alternatives to steroids? I’m not having the best of luck and rather scared of what I’m reading and what I’m feeling. I have had and al having some nasty side effects to the inhaled corticosteroid and I’m also reading the long term damage or effects are also pretty nasty. It’s hard because I’m getting a mixed emotion from two diff groups here. One being people say it’s directly inhaled and this just can’t be it. To two, it is true and they CAN cause nasty effects. I was put on Flovent after showing mild obstruction. My PFT raised 30% three weeks being on flovent. She labeled it as asthma based on three total PFT’s but only one was showing mild obstruction. I’m not even sure if the sudden shortness of breath I had come on me literally OVERNIGHT is asthma or what. I did suffer a massive GERD reflux attack that was what felt like straight better acid in my throat for a week straight despite prescription meds.. few days after that the weird feeling in my lungs began. Held off two months and it felt my breathing was getting harder and harder. So that lead to the PFT.. and now Flovent. I do not like the side effects and it is the ONLY thing that has changed and I have never in my life been so short fused to the point it scares me, yet I miss one dose and I feel like I can’t breathe! What does this sound like and what alternatives can there be with less side effects? Sure. Everyone metabolizes meds and handles them differently of course.. but anyone else In same boat? 

I also suffer Graves’ disease/ hyperthyroidism and these steroids make my hyperthyroidism that’s in remission feel as though it’s not. Just had my labs ran and I’m in normal range. 

Side effects: 
Night sweats (bad)
Agitation/short fuse (not like me at all)
Intrusive thoughts (scary)
Feeling hot to touch with no fever

But when she sprays it in the mornings I'm still trying to sleep and it triggers my asthma. Then I can't get enough sleep and am left with aggravated Airways.

58,"Hey all, I'm curious, and my research has so far proven futile.

(Personal context: My first Asthma attack was when I was 6, and once I hit 18-20, it leveled off. I'm in my mid-30s now. I'm a trained vocalist who had to stop singing years ago because of a Hiatus Hernia and severe GERD. About 8 weeks ago, I had a Nissen Fundoplication and the surgeon also sutured the hernia closed. This has had little to no practical effect on what I'm going to ask about, but the GERD *might* have caused damage, hence the mention.)

I typically experience a higher-pitched expiratory wheeze, which at least *feels* like it comes more from the upper end of my lower respiratory tract (ie. between the larynx, and where the main bronchi branch off). 

In the last year, with no preceding attacks or worsening of my condition, and only based on my sporadic blue puffer usage (salbutamol/albuterol), my doctors put me on QVAR and then Flovent, with little to no discernable improvement in the wheeze. (I'm on disability for other reasons, and have not been prescribed, nor been able to afford a Peak Flow Meter out of pocket. I will be getting one soon, with a settlement of sorts *FINALLY* on the horizon.) I am using my blue puffer a *TOUCH* less than I used to, down from 1-2 times a week, to maybe once every 7-10 days. Even still though, I have this expiratory high pitch wheeze. When I *do* take the blue puffer, the wheeze lessens to some extent, but it's still present.

To me, it's pretty concerning because the consistent wheeze comes across as a sign of something still not being addressed or investigated, but whenever any GP I've seen in 3 different clinics now (because hunting down a good doc for my other conditions is super-difficult) has listened to my chest, they will tell me it sounds clear and write off my concern without any explanation.

60,"I was diagnosed with asthma 1.5 year ago, even though I've come to find out my parents knew I had it when I was a kid but they refused to treat me for it. I don't think it's mild asthma, either.

I've been pretty awful about treating it myself because I had the hardest time accepting the diagnosis was true and then I've also lived with untreated asthma for so long that I can't quite tell when I'm having symptoms, so I never use the rescue inhaler and I kept going off the maintenance inhaler, too, sometimes for months at a time. 

That said, I've been pretty consistent about using sirdupla, which my doctor prescribed, for the last two months (two puffs in the morning and another two at night) and I'm also randomly using my rescue inhaler, trying to figure out when and how it helps. I've also been taking antihistamines for the past couple of weeks.

I have an appointment with my doctor two days from now but in the meantime, I'm concerned that I haven't seen much improvement. I still have plenty of trouble breathing, I have a hard time being indoors with a mask on, I have a stuffed nose and, I think, chest tightness.

I’ve discovered:

Sleep apnea (treated for 2 months with success in many issues and getting off caffeine)

High blood pressure treated for 5 years

High cholesterol for 5 years.

Been on antidepressants for 10 years with a change last year since I started having extreme issues again.

It appears my issues get worse in a few situations:

1-physical activity, sex, masturbation triggers it rather quickly

2-sinus congestion when not using high humidity on cpap

3-high stress but I rarely have this now


My issues are mostly (which come all together):

-diarrhea frequently 

-confusion

-focus issues

-shortness of breath

-dizziness or lightheadedness followed after

-full head and head pressures and vice grip type of feeling

-fatigue / lack of motivation or wanting to get up
-back / muscle ache

-sometimes chest tightness

-ear pressure / popping like feeling

-sinus congestion and making it harder to breathe out of my nose

-all of the above then trigger feelings of anxiety/stress due to what I’m going through

How things are going:

\-I can honestly say that I feel much better than I have in a loooong time. After like, months of waiting for Dupixent to really start working, I think it's *actually* working. My measure for this is that I used to not be able to walk around my block before Dupixent without having to go on a prednisone burst after. A couple months ago I was able to walk around the block, but it typically took me about three days to recover back to my baseline. Now, I can actually walk for several miles a day, as long as I take my inhalers beforehand, and feel totally fine after. I'm still not really used to this feeling, it seems like a dream! My FitBit is now actually a FitBit again and not just a sporty looking watch, lol (-:

What I wish I knew:

\-I wish I knew that it actually takes a really long time to start working. I mean, I did know that to some extent when I started it. But most studies apparently found that people experience the full effects after about a year, so I guess it's all uphill from here. Stick with it!

\-Side effects are not predictable. There's not really a pattern to how my body reacts to Dupixent after I take it, which is sort of a draw but if you go into it knowing that, there's fewer surprises. The side effects for me started with headaches a day or two after the injection, which was replaced by dry eyes. I had a moment about a month ago where I thought I might have become allergic to Dupixent due to some purplish red spots on my legs, but after a lot of (probably really annoying) messages to my doctor, I found out that it was actually erythma nodosum, which was unsightly but has gradually been going away. I can only assume that there will be more *wonderful (-:* various effects of Dupixent in the future, but the tradeoff is worth it by far. I've been on medications a lot more common that Dupixent and had much worse experiences. 

\-YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR INJECTION SITES. I know this seems obvious, but I really got into like a ""comfort zone"" of injecting in one spot. Switching it up reduces those injection site reactions.

1) my lungs sometimes ache, the past few days it's been a constant dull ache and it's getting annoying now. Drinking warm liquid like coffee is super soothing, as are baths. Are there any safe pain meds I can take for achy lungs? I read I'm supposed to avoid NSAIDS.

2) is achy lungs common with asthma? I can breathe fine at the moment, but the ache is still there. Is achy lungs a sign of a mild asthma attack or should I expect this every now and again? 

3)I have no idea what my triggers are. But I get asthma attacks so randomly. What tests should I ask for at my doctor's to find specifically what my triggers are?

I had the respirometry test done and the technician said to me ""You're not asthmatic, but you aren't normal either.""

My doctor looked at the report and just said ""You're negative.""

When I go for a run now, I feel like I'm blowing up way too easily, like 4km into a 10km run I'm gasping. Or if I do something involving heavy exertion, I end up shallow rapid breathing for quite sometime afterwards.

I am a regular user of vape products, and upon learning of her asthma, I discontinued vaping inside and on the property. She has been really great about this, and I feel quite awful she's experiencing problems. However, since I've stopped (I do still vape in my car on the way home and on walks around the neighborhood) she has mentioned having reactions when upstairs near my bedroom, and as her office is down the hall from my room, this seems like it could become a real issue for her.

19,"I've been put through the ringer a bit with testing for my symptoms. The main reason a general internist is seeing me is because I've ended up in the ER too many times for shortness of breath (SOB) on or without exertion with one or more of the following: tachycardia, persistent cough, generalized itching, chest pain, hoarse voice/frog in throat, neck pain, and/or low grade fever with bad chills. O2 is always fine, just heart rate high and sometimes hypertension. SOB is band enough ieven whenĺ I can't complete sentences or coughing nonstop.

One doctor thinks I have a mast cell disorder and this doctor doesn't necessarily disagree but says he can only focus on one thing, my breathing. So = asthma.

My PFT came back normal, it was stressful but good results. I was taking pulmicort and singulair which could've made results better. 

1.75 months of pulmicort 800 mcg reduced my SOB, fevers, lower chest pain, and migratory joint pain. Then the last week I'm getting the chest pain and SOB again. So they've switched me to Advair with 2 puffs daily. 

Is this more helpful? Idk. He said I'll need the Ventolin less and should recover faster from my SOB spells, said the chest pain will go away too.

20,"When I say cured what I mean is take it from a getting out of breath walking to being able exercise rigoursly. It's still most certainly there but a lot less.

To give some context I'm 23 (M) and have been living with Asthmha since birth pretty much I currently take  fostair as a preventive daily which works nicely without noticeable side effects.

The biggest triggers I have discovered for my Asthmha is allergies, I am allergic to basically everything, pollen, fungal spores, dust, dog dander etc as well as a huge amount of foods. 

So what I have done over the last few years is have allergy tests and take out all those foods and anything else I notice triggering my symptoms. I currently eat the same things everyday more or less - white rice and Avocados/frozen chopped spinach mixed with olive oil and split pea protein powder, bananas, mangoes, dates, apple juice blueberries, potatoes and sweet potatoes and a few more things. I take a few vitamins and all my levels are healthy (micro/macro nutrients) currently. It's restricting but more than worth it as a trade in for my breath. I attribute this to the biggest improvement.

Salt inhalers have also been really helpful as well as a product called Bioserum, woody knows nasal air filters have been a life saver in the past when exposed to airborne allergens and nose breathing in general helps. Changing my bedroom floor to laminate the use of an air purifier, I never use fragrance items my deodorant is a natural Alum salt, turmeric in the past has been helpful. All of the cleaning products, wash products are natural, I wash my bed sheets at 60 degrees C

Meditation has been a huge help, I've been practicing  since I was 18; it's helped with my breathing technique as well as the hopelessness and suffering of this disease over the years, with out It would have ended up in a really grim place mentally and stayed there. Also being selective of my workplace as I was once working in workshops/factories as an Engineer, changing that helped.

I've seen the most improvements over the last year and half and hope to continue that way unfortunately I was diagnosed last year with Ulcerative colitis but thanks to the NHS and big pharma that's under control now. The universe obviously decided I was having it to easy suddenly 🤣

Of course this is subjective but I can back it up through my own improvement and worsening of symptoms if I slip up

Don't get me  wrong! But it just seems that asthma is  always the one disease to be  thrown under the bus. While all of those  mentioned diseases are  terrible, let's just not forget how asthmatics  are lacking the one  thing that most people have no problem doing, BEING  ABLE TO BREATHE  AIR! In my 34 years of life, I have just never seen any  kind of major  charities endorsed by celebrities, or a""fight for  asthmatics month"" or  anything of the sort. I'm really not trying to  sound selfish but it  just kind of pisses me off, I think more attention  needs to be brought  to the disease, it completely takes over your life!  The first thing you  have to do when you wake up is do breathing  treatments just to get air  flowing, make sure you take all of your  medicine, and pray you can get  through the day without having an asthma  attack, for those wondering  what it feels like..try breathing through a  drinking straw &amp; see  how long you last.

52,"Hi guys

So I recently applied for the Australian Defence Force and I need to get my running skills, technique and endurance up. It requires a 6.5 beep test and a 2.4km run in 13 mins (will try to aim for 11-12mins)

I have suffered from asthma since I was young and I'm generally fine unless I exercise. Something about running, swimming or cycling just aggravates my asthma - during HS, I couldn't jog 200mm without almost fainting so I joined the gym club instead. Therefore, I havent done any endurance type cardio since I was probably 15. Probably because of powerlifting for a few years, my most recent beep test record I did on my own accord was a comfortable 6 (before getting a cramp/my fault for not stretching properly).

Just wondering if anyone can recommend how to practice for the beep test and 2.4km run, especially for people who suffer from exercise-induced asthma and haven't trained in running before. There's quite a bit of info online and on apps but they don't really seem geared towards people with asthma (e.g. recovery days ask for 30min jogs in the first week)

Any advice on training, technique and information is welcome and appreciated. Any recommendations for affordable running shoes will also be appreciated, my Converses probably werent the best to run in

58,"To my knowledge I have never had asthma or any issues breathing, I am generally pretty healthy and I exercise regularly. However, there have been maybe 10 times total in my life where I felt it was slightly harder to breathe after going for a run (almost always in the cold of winter), what I thought might be some type of extremely mild asthma, but it was never an issue and I never had it looked at. I have had seasonal allergies every spring for my whole life and I know that can make it more likely to get adult-onset asthma. And during my entire covid and post-covid experience I've had pretty awful allergies throughout (still do right now).

Last month, after a year of not leaving the house unless absolutely necessary, my roommate went out and met a friend and gave me covid a week later. I was devastated but my case was fortunately mild during infection. My lungs seemed to be mostly fine while I had it, but sometimes they would get wheezy and it felt slightly harder to breathe. Ever since, my lungs will be mostly okay for a few days or even a week and I think they're finally getting better (they never feel completely normal though, usually have a mild persistent cough), and then it feels like they are triggered by something and they get very wheezy again and it's hard to breathe for the next few days. It's been worse than it even was when I had covid. And my cough gets worse during those periods. It seems the cough is mostly triggered by exhalation (also it's a dry cough). My doctor prescribed an albuterol inhaler which I see online is pretty much only prescribed for asthma. The inhaler definitely helps me. If it's helping me, does that mean it is probable that I do in fact have asthma now? I will get my lungs tested in a few weeks to find out conclusively if I have asthma but I just wanted to know if you guys had any insights as to whether a virus can suddenly cause adult onset asthma and how likely it actually is that I have asthma. The doctors seemed to think it would likely go away in a few months at most but they also didn't seem 100% confident in that.

I rarely suffer from asthma -- was diagnosed with ""exercise-induced asthma"" a few years back after my first asthma attack. Got a rescue inhaler. Used it maybe 5x over 5 years.

Fast-forward to this week. On Monday night, I just Didn't Feel Right. I was lightheaded driving, felt short of breath, fatigue. Walking from the parking lot to my building took about 10 minutes and I needed to take two breaks. Felt disoriented and didn't even think to try my inhaler. Went to bed. Woke up in the morning, dizzy upon standing, out of breath showering. No, this is not right.

Went to my PCP who immediately did an EKG (I guess my symptoms are also women heart attack symptoms), chest xray, blood work. My blood work came back with an elevated ""D Dimer"" which can indicate a blood clot. After 5 missed calls and 2 voicemails from my nurse, I was given instructions to get to an ER stat. My blood work indicated I could have a blood clot.

Wow, they moved in a screaming hurry in the ER! I was hooked up to an EKG before I even had my temperature taken. In less than 3 hours, I had an EKG, blood work, CT scan with contrast. 

Good news: I'm not dying of a pulmonary embolism. That was very scary.

Bad news: I am under orders to stay inside until the air quality is better, as the expected Dx is ""asthma, exacerbated by irritants/pollen."" I feel trapped in my apt. I have a new steroid inhaler to take 2x/day.

I was prescribed albuterol for it and was supposed to take it as needed. Over summer break I needed it a few times but not much. Never more than twice a week. Well I started running last summer and after that I barely ever needed it. I was overweight and I lost some of that weight and my breathing felt a lot better in general. Well over the last few days I feel like it’s come back and was hoping to see what might be triggering it and how much of it is just anxiety. I don’t know if I have allergies or what but I’ve had a scratchy throat and some congestion and post nasal drip the past few days. It could’ve been from where it’s been so hot where I live. And I also went into the woods yesterday to walk with my girlfriend and that probably didn’t help matters. Well today I still had the scratchy throat and it turned into it being slightly harder to breathe in more and a cough. And I’ve had my Covid vaccine so I doubt it’s that so I’m assuming it’s allergies. I used my oximeter and it was jumping between 96 and 98 depending on the finger and I did my peak flow meter and it was around 550 which is normal I guess. I don’t know anything about the numbers other than what I’ve looked up and it says it’s in the normal range. I still used my inhaler to see if it would help and it has some. I can take deeper breaths now. It kinda gives me the shakes though and it makes me a bit more anxious. But now Ive gotten more anxious because I’ve tried to manually take deeper breaths and sometimes it feels like I can’t get a deep breath in. I saw someone else on this sub talking about how they do that anxiously. I have pretty severe anxiety and health anxiety is what makes it worse.

8,"Hello everyone,
Two years ago I got diagnosed with exercise induced asthma and had QVAR and Albuterol prescribed to me. As time passed the asthma seemingly went away and I essentially forgot about it. Lately I have been extremely stressed and have a tightened feeling in my chest (and some mucus) making it a bit harder to breathe but nothing crazy. I don’t have any wheezing or cough at the moment. Yesterday I decided to take a puff of QVAR and felt relief in terms of breathing after like 20-30 mins. My doctor two years ago told be to take a single puff twice a day so I followed the same rules.

I thought this would be a one and done thing so I didn’t take another dose after I woke up, but today I had another slight discomfort after exercising showing some signs of “chest tightness/shortness of breath”and mucus. I decided to take QVAR again because of this. Right now my chest is slightly tight but is getting more relaxed as time is passing. I don’t have pain when breathing, but mostly slight discomfort. I’m pretty anxious as of now since this feels kind of out of the blue for me. My dad has a similar asthma condition (he feels slight congestion due to allergies) and has told me not to take the Albuterol since that is for emergencies. Is there anything I should be wary of because of this sudden flare up? When should I take Albuterol since I never really used it before?

I’ve been using a high dose of Advair (230/21, 4 puffs a day) for the last ~3 months. Although it’s been controlling my asthma pretty well, I’ve been noticing some side effects. Firstly, I’ve been getting a lot of muscle cramps and muscle weakness at times too. The cramps have been mostly in my feet, but other places at times too. I know that it could obviously be do to other things as well, but this has only started after using Advair for a few months now because it rarely ever happened before. My acne has been strong; although this could also be due to other things, I’m pretty sure that this inhaler isn’t helping either. At times I do notice hoarseness in my voice after use, but I’ve cut this down a lot by rinsing my throat with a full cup of warm water every time. Other than that, I haven’t noticed much else other than insomnia if I forget and take it late, and some increased irritability (again, could be due to other things LOL).

21,I just left my appointment with an allergist/ asthma specialist and I’m a little confused.. he ran a few breathing tests and said there wasn’t evidence showing I have asthma and that would explain why the inhaler they gave me hasn’t been helping. They ran an allergy panel and allergy shot test showing I was allergic to cats and dogs and some grasses/ pine. I started showing tightness in my chest and trouble breathing like taking a full breath comfortably and labored breathing a little over a month ago. I have lived with my dogs for over 5 years with no allergy symptoms and my breathing difficulties and cough started a month ago out of the blue. I stopped working out completely a month ago when this started to take it easy until I met with a professional. He said it could be exercise induced asthma and gave me a prescription for a new inhaler to start using before my work outs. I’m just confused because I haven’t worked out at all since this started because I haven’t been feeling well so I’m confused how it would be exercise induced. He said I should start working out again and use the inhaler and we will move from there a month from now. He suggested allergy shots later on if I don’t feel better in a month but I’m not sure if I should try to get a second opinion from a different allergy specialist or a pulmonologist. I guess I was hoping I could get some answers sooner than that because I have been feeling really shitty and was hoping I could get an allergy medication or at least a more clear understanding of what’s going on. When this started I was tested for Covid and it was negative. He said it could be GERD or vocal cord dysfunction but that he thinks it’s exercise induced asthma.

So I'm a long time asthmatic and have been pretty bad for most of my life. (I'm 26m) for many years I had been using Symbicort thinking that it was the best I could do. Last Christmas I got Covid and it messed me up real bad. I almost was hospitalized and was using 2-3 nebulizers a day just to keep my oxygen in the low 90s. Well after I recovered, my asthma seemed to still be pretty bad. I typically will blow through an Albuterol rescue inhaler about every 1-1.5 months. That rate was doubled in the immediate month following covid. I talked to my doc about it and he recommended that I try a long acting inhaler called Trelegy Elliott.

53,"Hello everyone, been following this reddit for a long time and been trying to muster up the right words without making it the longest read but I'll try to keep as many details as I can and am open for private messages for any questions...so lets get on it with it.

I'll start with my current issues, I'm a tad bit overweight now (30lbs) muscular build, but could def shed a few #'s in the belly, I'm 100% sure this attributes to more severe flare ups during exercise. I was more healthy pre covid and actively at a gym and doing a lot better keeping my asthma under control but always had my albuterol. I really can only blame myself for my body condition, but I think we've all went through funks of depression where motivation is absolutely stagnant or even finding a girlfriend or boyfriend where you get comfortable with each, have a passion for food rather than exercise, lol. Whether it be a new job your putting a lot of time into making time for exercise can be difficult in life.

Now lets rewind two decades back when I was a child getting nebulizer treatments in elementary schools and felt like the bubble boy. My allergist pricked my arm with various substances and there wasn't one thing I wasn't allergic to that I'd still say the majority of the population around me are more affected by; pollon, ragweed, dander, dust mites, you name it. I felt like I was mentally brainwashed to think I'd be some ""weaker"" person my whole life. At this time in my life I was on Ventolin and Intal(sp?), if I recall correctly. The attacks were scary but manageable, sometimes I could power through them with deep breathing and meditation but scary none the less.

Fast forward to High School I'm now I'm playing football, tennis, baseball etc., constant activity and exercise definitely helped build up my lung strength, I still had a rescue inhaler but also on Advair daily preventative, I can't recall how well I took it everyday but I tried my best as a young adolescent, eventually I just stopped using it because the powder stuff just tasted gross in my throat. Like I said, I was told I was allergic to everything, including cats and dogs, I still am definitely bothered my cats, (scratchy throat/itchy eyes) but when It came to sleepovers at friends houses with pets I kind of just powered through them and tried building a tolerance which brings up my biggest point of my post. I think as all asthmatics we need to expose ourselves to things that might upset us, I'm currently a golf course Superintendent and I was told I was allergic to grass, I don't take any allergy medicine in the Spring time which I think is amazing compared to friends I have that don't even have asthma, now I know allergies and asthma are totally different things, but to I'm still proof that I conquered what I was once told would debilitate me.

I'm no doctor but I think the less medication we can take and build up our natural immunity to things is a wise decision. Winters &amp; cold air still upset me and I will always need that inhaler by my side, but many times I try to take deep breaths and control my flareups without needing the crutch that is my inhaler. I'd say my asthma has been very under control since being on the nebulizer treatments as a child and only needing albuterol as a backup, but I also asked my doctor about a preventative that I really will recommend to everyone which was Symbicort. During the Winter when I was active/ snowboarding and again overweight and a little out of shape I would use my Albuterol at least 10 times a day which I definitely do not recommend, it is also generic so I think it really doesn't have as much punch as a true Ventolin.

Finally I just want to say this disease really sucks and I never would wish it on anyone and everyone's experiences will vary, but I just wanted to tell you my experience in the shortest way possible and try to urge you to be careful and have your medicine but use it as a last resort, try meditation and deep breathing, its not fun and may take over 10 minutes to control an attack, but one day you might not have your inhaler in your pocket so practicing other techniques and exposing yourself to things you were told you need to avoid may actually make you more resilient. Humans have an amazing away of adapting to the dangers we face in this world, I know like many of you wish to be fully off any medicine and I hope maybe they cant mutate our DNA and do that..one day, but until now, be strong, be a fighter, and try to find ways to fight this disease before reaching for that inhaler, like I mentioned before I'm overweight at least 30lbs and I know that isn't helping to control my current condition. To this day I'm a lot better around peoples pets, but oddly my aunt and uncles shiatzus which are hypoallergenic have bothered my throat and eyes...weird I know. I work outside everyday on the golf course and breath clean fresh air that I'm sure is full of allergens, but somehow I conquered them.

59,"Hey all! A couple months ago, out of the blue, I started having shortness of breath. The only other time this has happened was last year for about a week when I was deployed (couldn’t get tested for COVID, but have since been vaccinated). I’m a fit 28yo male, smoked cigs a long time ago but quit in 2015, then smoked on deployment. The weekend before my symptoms began, I smoked a cig for the first time in a year, and I started running outside as winter turned to spring. I haven’t smoked since.

Anyway, after a couple days, the Military docs told me it sounded like asthma so they prescribed me an Albuterol rescue. I went to the ER the next day because I had trouble breathing and I was experiencing nervousness/HR increases (found out that was a side effect so I’ve since been given symbicort). The ER doc looked at a chest X-ray and my EKG, told me I’m perfectly fine in those areas, and told me I have reactive airway disease and I need to see a specialist—so fast forward to now.

My current doctor through the VA has been awesome and all my blood tests have come back fine. He says my asthma is atypical because I don’t have too bad of a wheeze, and virtually no cough, but I still have SOB. He says not to be too concerned because I can still workout fine etc., but it still a bit odd to me that all the sudden I may have triggered some sort of asthma. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? I see the pulmonologist next month, and if they tell me it’s not asthma, should I be frightened given my symptoms? This is all quite odd to me!

I've read some very interesting studies on severe Asthma and its effects on daily functioning, where people in the study as well as the study authors themselves categorize severe Asthma as a disability. Mild Asthma seems to, more often, be recognized as a chronic illness or disease. 

Do you feel like you personally identify with one of these labels? Both? None? Something different entirely? Does this distinction depend on how your Asthma is categorized, or by how it affects you? Does this distinction impact you or change anything about your relationship with the world?

I know-really 'deep' question. But I am genuinely curious about how Asthmatics would consider themselves. As a person with Severe Asthma which only developed around three years ago, I am struck by the stark contrast between my life before and after diagnosis, yet I feel that I'm uncertain about labelling myself ""as"" anything.

70,"So, I have been diagnosed with allergic asthma about 2 months back and have been put on montelukast and daily inhalers for about 2 months. 
This diagnosis was after my SPO2 was observed to be fluctuating and dropping to 93 a few times while I went for diagnosis of some other issue.

It's almost been a year of these fluctuations and the pattern is 93-94 everytime when I start measuring my SPO2 (normal breathing while sitting or lying down) and in a minute or so it goes to 95 everytime (sometimes 96). 
If I deep breathe 2-3 times or work out a little or any form of physical activity it rises to 97-98.

Almost 4 doctors have not shown any concerns on this pattern but I keep wondering why does it drop to 93 when sitting and breathing normally and does it happen for others with asthma?

6,"Hi guys

So I recently applied for the Australian Defence Force and I got a call about my medical history. They asked about my medical history and I told them that I had asthma as a child, haven't been on a preventer since high school (16, I'm 25 now), and only use an inhaler when I really have to. I'm an active weightlifter and haven't suffered any asthma attacks since maybe I was 4 years old.

I just want to enquire if there are any asthma or lung tests you can do yourself or with a GP so understand more about your asthma. The idea is I can get rejected because I have asthma but if I have mild control asthma, I may pass depending on my role. I just want to see where I am currently

But navigating my insurance situation... It's got me to the point where today I went back and forth between screaming bloody murder and just curling up in a ball and crying. I feel so utterly helpless in this terrible, broken healthcare system in the USA.

First, their formulary didn't cover the drugs I was originally prescribed. That was frustrating, but at least there was a solution. Now I'm on drugs that are covered. The free samples have helped me so much, but I'm struggling to get the prescription filled.

I have Cigna which requires me to use the express scripts mail order pharmacy. Well I'm almost out of my sample meds and still haven't gotten the delivery. Also there's no tracking status on the package for nearly a week, no one knows where it is. I fought with the insurance today, because omg I'm feeling so much better with these samples I just want my meds. They gave me an exception for a 30 day supply via Walgreens. Which cost 3x as much as a mail order 90 day supply.

I just don't know what to do. I feel so totally helpless here. I have a good paying job but I don't want to be spending hundreds of dollars every month on my medication. This is just utterly horrifying. I'm going to keep trying to make the mail order work, hopefully that 90 day supply will show up within the next week. This is just such a hot mess.

It's never posed much of an issue to me except for using an inhaler sometimes after hard exercise, laughing a lot, breathing something in funny, etc. One thing that's been constant in my life though is I always get really bad colds when I get the common cold. I'll get really congested, feel weak and spend a whole day throwing up either phlegm or bile. Since those liquids keep building up in my stomach, I'll also throw up any liquids I drink. I get dehydrated, super thirsty and just feel horrible all day long. This has happened to me once to twice a year from childhood to 2018. In 2018 I started drinking orange juice and running regularly, this is my first time getting sick in 3 years.

Yesterday was one of those horrible days. I feel much better now but throwing up all day was miserable.

Within the last month, my need for a rescue inhaler has gone down drastically. I used to use it numerous times a month, but I’ve only had to use it when my allergies (and pollen count is very high right now and I’m very allergic to oak trees) got bad, three times within the last week and a half because my mother cut the grass (I’m very allergic) and twice in the entirety of April. *In the entirety of April.*

This is a massive improvement from the last year of suffering I’ve had after my severe asthma diagnosis. I’m right smack in the middle of allergy season, all my allergens are in full swing, and I’ve only had to use my rescue inhaler when my mother’s cut the lawn and the pollen count was in the severe range. Literally nothing in my life (or medication routine) has changed except being fully vaccinated.

Do you think it would be worth it to ask for another PFT to see what my lung capacity is and if it’s changed at all since last year when I last got one? Is there a possibility that the vaccine drastically reduced lung inflammation?

50,"So I have relatively newly diagnosed eosinophilic asthma and my doctor is trying to get me on a shot to lower the number of eosinophils in my blood, however, my insurance keeps denying saying ""there's not enough proof that I have asthma"" and ""try daily inhaler/rescue inhaler/steroids."" 

1. The number one test for eosinophilic asthma is the blood test. Which was provided multiple times, always over their threshold for diagnosis. 

2. We've tried them all. Im using a rescue inhaler at least once a day on top fo my wixela 2x daily. And I had an asthma attack bad enough to land me in the er where they gave me a breathing treatment and iv steroids, then a prescription for 50mg prednisone for the following week. Within 30 minutes of starting the iv steroids, my blood pressure spiked dangerously high (210/130) but I could breath. The effect was almost immediate. They'd taken my blood at that visit, and as expected, my eosinophils were astronomically high. The next week I had an appointment with my hematologist and prior to the appointment, she had a blood test run, my eosinophils were at 0. It felt like I didn't have asthma, I felt normal (except the blood pressure, and the fact that high doses of prednisone nearly immediately causes fluid to accumulate in my belly which hurts.)  Within a week of that appointment, I'd been off the prednisone for a week and scheduled an appointment to see my regular doctor about my blood pressure that had still refused to go down and was sent *back* to the er where they couldn't get my blood pressure under control with 3 different medications. They took my blood then and my eosinophils were already at the very upper limit of normal. It took close to a month of treatment before my blood pressure was normal again and stopping it means a spike. So even though it works, I can't take prednisone again without a substantial risk to my health. It's not worth damaging one part of my body to fix another. 

I've already had another appointment with my hematologist and my eosinophils are back to pre prednisone levels and I'm having daily asthma attacks, some that come right back within 2 minutes of using my rescue inhaler.

I said it was never severe asthma and that I did get treatment for some time, I just hadn't had treatment for a few years and that salbutamol gave me tachycardia. She wouldn't let that go, she kept saying that it could not be asthma if I didn't have a treatment. Later I said I needed some proof of my asthma so that my doctor would sign me up for the vaccine as a risk group and first she said that that was only for severe asthma. Then she said that you can't really diagnose asthma?? But that if I had relatives with asthma it was most likely that I had it too and I was like yes, I do have it, I was actually diagnosed after getting exams done. She even had a spirometry exam in front of her and she said that yeah, it wasn't good and it could suggest asthma, but that there was no way to diagnose it for sure.

She would not stop talking even if I tried interrupting her. I tried asking that how could a respiratory disease not be a risk factor for another respiratory disease?? But she just went on and on. I can't believe I heard all of this from an actual specialist. At least she gave me meds and a paper to sign up for the vaccine. I don't know if I should trust this doctor?

63,"Hello everyone!

I was officially diagnosed with asthma three months ago, and just discovered this subreddit last week. I was wondering if feeling anxious and restless was a normal side effect of taking your rescue inhaler. I've found that within a few seconds of taking my rescue inhaler, I start feeling really shaky and restless. And unless I'm doing some kind of physical activity that lets me ""burn off"" that nervous energy, it'll almost always manifest as anxiety. 

It's to the point that I've been avoiding taking my rescue inhaler unless I'm exercising -- which wasn't a big deal when I thought I only had asthma attacks when exercising. But after stalking this sub for a few days, I'm realizing that a lot of things I chalked up to ""my allergies"" or ""my immune system sucking"", or even just plain ""being tired"", are actually minor asthma attacks. I'd love to take my inhaler in these cases, but I don't want to deal with the anxiety afterwards.

So I guess my two big questions are: 1) Is it normal to feel anxious after taking a rescue inhaler? 2) If so, is there anything I can do to alleviate that anxiety? 3) If not, should I maybe try looking into a different kind of rescue inhaler? (I'm currently on abuterol.)

69,"Other conditions: ADHD (Diagnosed Age 30 in 2019, medicated with 54mg Concerta), very high-stress life due to work, family and ADHD. Mother was born with FASD.

I have had diagnosed Asthma since 2018 (Age 28), but started to feel symptoms around 2016.
There began to be this tightness in my chest that was fairly mild. I'd just hit my chest a couple of times to try and make the feeling go away. Then as time went on it started to get a little worse. In around 2017, when I would sit down to eat my lunch at work, I just felt like I couldn't get enough air. I felt like I had to loosen the belt on my pants to breathe but even that didn't really do anything. Only getting up and walking around lessened the symptoms.
Evenetually, around spring of 2018, I kept having a very difficult time trying to get air. As if my lungs were filling, but I wasn't getting any benefit from it. I started having what my doctor diagnosed as anxiety attacks. It just didn't feel like anxiety though, because I felt calm, and when the attacks came I completely numbed myself to remain calm and take steady breathes but nothing was working.
Then I eneded up having a big attack in traffic, where i felt like I was having a heart attack and had to call an ambulance. My skin felt like it was vibrating, my hands and jaw locked up, and felt like I was going to pass out. The EMT's said it was an anxiety attack. 
I ended up going for a lung function test after that and I was diagnosed with Asthma due having about 50% lung capacity. Since then I have been using Salbutamol and Symbicort.

I take the Symbicort once in the morning and once before bed. Other than having to get up to use the washroom during the night, I don't wake up because of asthma as long as I take my inhaler. My issue is that it feels like I always have a lingering tightness in my chest. Symbicort is meant to help with inflammation of the lungs but they never really feel like their irritated or hot. I did a recent lung fuction test about 8 months ago, and I was told that my lungs are at 110%, the respirologist said it's better than her lungs. 
When the chest tightness becomes worse, I take my inhalers, but it doesn't really feel like it acts quickly. Almost like it takes about 30 min to do anything. I can take full breathes, but it just makes me feel light-headed. It makes me feel a little sweaty and shakey. Does this sound familiar to anybody else? My doctor has done many tests to humour me, but I am apparently very healthy. I also don't have any real asthma triggers at all. I mean if there's enough dust to blur vision, that affects me, but nothing else. I have good blood pressure
He's also told me that anxiety can hit even when you're calm, or not doing anything to be anxious about. So that can also contribute tot he tightness. It's very confusing to me.
I just need to know someone else is in the same boat, and that they have similar asthma issues. I just find it strange that the asthma appeared out of nowhere, and that I can't completely control it with inhalers.",Asthma,Age 31-Male-Diagnosed 2018 (Symptoms Question),1620435963

73,"Hello. I'm 21, I got diagnosed with mild asthma and was prescribed a DPI as a preventative inhaler (brand name is called a Revolizer in my area). However, after googling, I've seen people talk about the side effects of inhaled steroids such as glaucoma (which I'm worried about because one of my eyes has very poor vision already, extremely blurry) acne and weight gain among some of them.

I'm wondering whether it's even necessary for me to take this DPI because my asthma doesn't really bother me except the dust allergy that I have where I sneeze multiple times a day-- that's because my dog stays in my room. However last year when I kept him out of my room, my allergy almost completely disappeared, I very rarely sneezed. Apart from that, my only other trigger is if I laugh too hard, and I very occasionally have shortness of breath or a whistling sound from my chest, but these things don't bother me that much.

I guess I'm just considering whether I really need this and whether the potential side effects from long-term inhaler use is worth it. I also got prescribed a reliever inhaler-- can't I just use that occasionally when I need it rather than use the preventative every single day?

81,"I was diagnosed with asthma as a child and used a nebulizer. I had hay fever and some bad seasonal allergies. Fast forward to today at the age of 29. I have not thought about asthma much starting around high school. I have not used a nebulizer since a child. I did have some wheezing when I would cycle to work in the winter, but I was quickly diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma by a physician assistant and prescribed an inhaler to be used before exercise. I do still have seasonal allergies which are annoying and sometimes day-ruining, but I am used to them.

I just switched to a much better health insurance than I previous had which led me to a new doctor. They have a good reputation, and they also seem to specialize in allergies as well. They provide allergy shots at their office (which I am about to start). I got my physical this week and everything was looking good until I used the spirometer. They measured my total breath out and said my score was 55% and 59% which were low. They wanted to see above 70%. They listened to my breath with a stethoscope  and said they could hear that I had asthma. They prescribed singulair (montelukast) for 3 months with the idea that if it does not improve that I start a daily inhaler.

This was surprising for me. I am active. I rock climb for 2 hours about 3 times a week. I do yoga for 30 minutes every morning daily. I walk and move regularly. I cycle to work sometimes (8 miles), and I occasionally do longer rides for fun (about 60 miles). If it is cold outside, and I forget to use my inhaler before exercising, I will start wheezing (not unmanageable) but if I take it I am fine.

My question is, is it normal to be prescribed a medication for asthma when you are not actively suffering from asthma? My doctor insists I take montelukast so that I can score higher on a spirometer, but if I am not having any issues does this spirometer result really mean anything? I am open to try the medication to see if I notice some kind of improvement, but I am skeptical and wondering if this is normal.",Asthma,Asthma medication prescribed without any wheezing or trouble breathing,1620314387

In those years I used to play football, run, swim, everything and had no problems. Then around 17 horses start causing me allergic reactions, so whenever I was near a horse or an animals place I needed to use the inhaler because it caused me phlegms. Then corn harvesting season around November-December started causing me problems too. I never had these allergies as a kid. Now I’m allergic to dust too.

In my twenties I still used to work out and sometimes I needed my inhaler, most of the cases when I was running. 

But now I’m 24, I haven’t worked out in one year (lol) and these past 4 months I’ve been waking up at night feeling short of breath and with wheezes. I can’t even take a short walk or carrying something heavy without having an asthma attack or wheezings. It’s awful and worrisome. I don’t know what happened, what did I changed in my lifestyle?

- I moved to a new place 1 year ago. The place has mold in the kitchen but not in my bedroom. My workplace is near the kitchen.
- I stopped doing exercise.
- I started smoking cigarettes 3 years ago smh, even I knew I got mild asthma symptoms (stupid I know). In average all this years like 3-4 cigarettes a month. I stopped 2 months ago.
- Unbelievable but from 4 years to now I haven’t had a respiratory diseases like cough! But one thing I have noticed is allergic symptoms got really worse. My every day is waking up with runny nose and watery eyes and through all the day is the same.

- Curious: I have notice that when I’m drinking alcohol and I dance a lot, I don’t get any symptoms wtf?! Or when I swim symptoms doesn’t appear so fast.

Questions

- Can exercise help me improve my condition?
- If allergies are the problem, how is that physical activity triggers the asthma symptoms?
- Do I need to change something in my environment? I live in a small rural town, air is clean but there’s a lot of pollen, dust, animals, etc.

I've had breathing issues the past years, I've always thought it was asthma related to my Silent Reflux. I have GI issues as well so I'm wondering if there could be a relation too.

I'm just wondering if anyone can give me some insight on my results

5,"This is going to be a long post but please bare with me! Back in October 2020 I started having chest pain and shortness of breath. It landed me in the hospital because I’m a hypochondriac and thought I was having a heart attack. When I saw my primary doctor for a follow up she was pretty positive the chest pain and shortness of breath was anxiety but wanted me to have a PFT just to rule anything more serious out. I got the PFT and then a few weeks later did the methacholine test and both of those tests came back normal. Fast forward to December and I started to notice some chest tightness and a dry cough. By February the cough seemed to get a little worse. Aside from the coughing, I would also get random spells where it almost felt like my chest was vibrating/purring (like a cat lol) when I would breathe in and out and sometimes when I’d cough I’d taste blood but there was no blood in my spit at all. I had just switched insurance plans and had to get a new primary care doc and he sent me for a chest X-ray which also came back clear. A few weeks later I went back to him because the cough still hadn’t cleared up, and he referred me to a pulmonologist. The pulmonologist literally asked some questions, listened to my chest and said “you have asthma.” He prescribed some inhalers and said he’d see me back in 3 months. Me being the hypochondriac I am, I had already convinced myself I’ve got lung cancer at this point so I wasn’t convinced it was asthma and wanted a 2nd opinion. Today I had the 2nd opinion and they think it’s asthma too. They did a niox (FeNO test?) to measure the inflammation I have in my lungs and I guess it helps to see if I’d benefit from certain inhalers. The normal reading is supposed to be under 25 and I scored a 43 which definitely shows some inflammation. They want me to take the inhalers the first doctor prescribed, and come back for a PFT in a few weeks. I was honest about my anxiety of lung cancer and she said she definitely didn’t think that was the case since I was only a smoker for 5 years and quit 5 years ago and I’m only 25. But she did say if the inhalers didn’t help or my symptoms continued to get worse, she would order a chest X-ray. Soooo I guess my question here is, what the hell? 😅 Is it possible to have a negative PFT AND negative methacholine challenge and then still get diagnosed with asthma? I apparently had asthma as a kid and I do remember having “attacks”, but I have no idea what tests my parents got done in order for me to actually get that diagnosis. I’m just feeling frustrated at this point. If it’s asthma then okay, I can handle that. But I don’t want to accept this diagnosis if it’s only being used to avoid digging deeper into why I have these symptoms.",Asthma,Asthma diagnosis with negative PFT and methacholine challenge?,1620102396

So this morning I went to urgent care and they prescribed a round of steroids and an advair inhaler (which is something I have used before but only for brief periods when it is really bad). How long until this back pain goes away? Should I be worried about something more serious like pneumonia?

I've had asthma and allergies for 25 years and I seems to get worse every year. It seems like the docs are very reluctant to give us a steroid maintenance inhaler (had to fight them on this). Why is that?

Also they wouldn't give me a nebulizer treatment or xray at the urgent care like they would typically do. Is this just because of covid or is everyone expected to have their own damn nebulizer machine now??

33 year old diagnosed with exercise induced asthma June 2017, but I knew it was more than that. Could never get a deep breath in. The ceiling on my breaths got lower and lower as months went by. Had lots of chest pain. No wheezing or typical asthma symptoms. Finally saw a respirologist and did the lung function tests and was diagnosed with ...always asthma. Hahaha more than exercise induced. The second inhalation of Methacholine sent me into the typical asthma attack.  Started Symbicort March 2020, which sent my resting heart rate into the 120s. Switched to Flovent May 2020 and I was a whole new person. Was able to exercise summer 2020 like I’ve never been able to before. 

Fall 2020, start experiencing some health issues related to an autoimmune condition (Hashimotos) as well as endometriosis. Exercise stops. 

Over winter 2020/2021 I noticed whenever I walked quickly to my car, did minor shoveling (and I mean minor), etc. I had burning chest pain, especially with a deep breath. I thought maybe it was just the cold air. I haven’t been able to take such lovely deep breaths for a long time. 

However, recently, I’ve been able to exercise again, so I’ve been hopping on the treadmill which has always been my main source of exercise. But I’m experiencing that burning chest pain as soon as my heart rate is elevated, and the more out of breath I get from the cardio, the more it hurts, especially on the deep breaths. When I slow down and relax my heart rate a bit, it goes away minus a small lingering “something hurt earlier” sensation quite quickly. Within minutes. I’ve had a chest X-ray, ecg, and echo within the last year that were all normal.

42,"30F, have gotten a pulmonary function test recently and was told I have above average lung performance. However, I've had a chronic cough following a bout of bronchitis for the last 4 months. I'm wondering if any of you have had a similar experience or could offer advice.

Here's the scoop: I have occasional shortness of breath and white phlegm, but very seldom. It is usually a dry cough that gets intense for a few days at a time. The first few months I had a lot of chest tightness and an ever-present tickling feeling in my lungs. Right now I only notice it if I force a really deep breath.

Was given Flovent 250mg twice a day, two puffs for a week, which seemed to disagree with me because I lost my voice and coughed even more. That might have just been preliminary lung clearing symptoms, but I'm not sure. I have albuterol as a rescue inhaler, but I have only noticed a mild difference the dozen times I've used it and can't tell if it's my own placebo effect. I have a nasal spray that mostly just seems to dry out my nostrils and make me prone to nose bleeds. My general doctor thinks my lungs are just recovering very slowly from the bronchitis, but I'm skeptical because of the off/on nature of the coughing. My allergist disagrees.

Chest x-ray came up clean. No wheezing. Been confirmed via skin and blood tests to have the following allergies: anaphylactic to milk and NSAIDs, also allergic to grass, pollen, and dog dander. I have owned a massively shedding husky for the last 3 years with no issues until now, zero congestion, except if he licks me I might get a hive from his saliva. I've tried to see if spending a lot of time close to my dog triggers my cough, but I haven't noticed a direct correlation so far. 

Allergist thinks exposure over time to my dog (and to milk powders where I used to work) has given me adult onset asthma, but the PFT technician said I can't have asthma because of how well my lungs are doing - 100 pulse ox, above average results, only 6% increase after albuterol which is below the 13% diagnosis threshold. I have been referred to do a metacholine challenge test, but the appointment is not for another few months.

I'm not on any other meds, and I don't experience seasonal congestion or post nasal drip on a regular basis. This all started in the dead of winter so I'm doubting the pollen allergies are related. I used to have a lot of acid reflux a year ago before I became anaphylactic to milk, but since I have removed dairy entirely from my diet, I've not had any notable reflux. The cough started 6 months after removing dairy.

I just found out i may have inherited from my mom a cousin of HIV called HTLV 1 but am scared to get tested at the moment. Otherwise I'm F19, healthy, thin. A while ago I was diagnosed with hyperreactive bronchi but not asthma bc I was coughing up mucus only a lot for a while when I was also very stressed. Now I see the symptoms align much much more with bronchiectasis which is like non cystic fibrosis which I knew wasn't possible but seemed like just a more extreme version of what I have. On a spirometer test nobody said my bronchi were wide like in bronchiectasis, i got cortisol to widen them actually but it didn't help. Could they have been overly wide and the lung specialist didn't notice?

So I need to go to an internal medicine doctor's appointment for a referral because of some pain issues with my knees and hips, but I'm wondering because I'd like to return to physical activity possibly in better condition since I've always had trouble with running and high intensity aerobic exercise specifically  (meaning strengh training for some reason doesn't give me much problems), often it got so bad I'd have blackouts that no one could explain and blood sugar wasn't the problem because I got tests.

So I've never been able to pinpoint the cause to those issues when I was in gym class and as far as my allergies (sinus and skin allergies) I sorta resigned myself to them always giving me some meassure of grief even with medication. My logic when I was younger was that I was never gonna be a professional athleat, obviously my output was never gonna be good enough, I simply did sports for myself even when I wasn't feeling very good because many times when I said I wasn't feeling alright most of the adults who trained me didn't seem to pay attention to me.

So as I grew I got into sports I liked more (martial arts), with coaches who were a lot more personable and reasonable, I learned to condition myself better and gained a lot more muscle on this regime.

I still struggled with cardio and endurance training, a little less but still got dizzy spells and occassional bouts of congestion and coughs.

But since becoming an adult I've taken a little break from so much exercise, my weight hasn't fluctuated much, I do not smoke nor do I drink often, I eat well, I'm relatively healthy yet I still get slightly fatigued, winded and worse of all since I sometimes have to pull all nighters do to college I get dry coughs in the middle of the night that I can't explain, and they sound nothing like when I got colds when I got younger, they're a lot more ""chesty""?

After about 2-3 hours the wheezing subsides until the next morning ( sometimes it will come back for a second, but a cough or throat clearing handles it ) . I deal with this 5-6 days a week. Even that one day a week I dont wake up wheezing, I do have a productive cough still. I also sometimes get out of breath with extremely simple tasks. Not all the time, though. Example, just walking to the laundry room from the bedroom carrying a basket of laundry will make me out of breath 1 out of 5 times. Another thing I struggle to do is climb stairs like I used to. I work on the 3rd floor of my workplace, and when I take the stairs in the morning I feel like I am going to pass out when I get to the 3rd floor.

87,"I've always had chronic allergies. Normal but severe stuff, sneezing, coughing, runny nose, itchy eyes were the worst! When I was mid-teens, I had my first and only ""attack""- airways were closing, confirmed by the hospital I went to, I was given a treatment through a mask and then given a rescue inhaler and made an appointment to be tested for asthma. They had me do some physical activity, had me blow into a tube, and said I don't have it and basically acted like I was being stupid, so I dropped it.

The problem is, it seemed to be directly related to my cat and dust allergies, because I wasn't exercising when it started. I was cuddling kittens and helping a friend with some dusty old furniture. Nothing heavy or overly exerting. From then on I had worsening symptoms- tight chest, wheezing, and more and more my voice would be ""caught"" if I tried to speak or breath.

I've also always always wheezed after exercise (but never to a point of a problem), especially in winter.

For the last few months, I've been constantly, progressively short of breath, I wheeze at random times but especially at night, I have a weird tickle in my throat in the same place where my voice would catch during the attack, and it makes me cough a lot and I usually have to take some time to breathe before it stops. Because I've been having sooooo many health issues lately in general, I didn't think to separate this from any other things I'm worried about.

Well, tonight, after walking around town by tons of blooming flowers (pollen, like most common allergens, is one of my big ones) and in the cold air, I ended up coughing and wheezing worse than usual, and I remembered my rescue inhaler! (I replaced it recently just because my old one expired and I was at the ER and asked the doctor about it.) It worked, and I'm breathing more easily right now than I have in about a year. No wheezing, no struggling to breathe, very very little coughing that I think is just because so much coughing irritated my throat...

So then, they didn't test for the right kind of asthma? Or could the test not have been accurate? Could this be some other issue? I have not and do not have covid.

My insurance company (which, ironically, I work for) has denied every medication my doc tried to prescribe me. I'm being forced to do this step therapy crap, where I can't use my docs preferred drugs but must first try alternatives.

Hopefully those alternatives will work for me. I have a doc appointment in a week where I'm going to try and work stuff out. But I'm just trapped in this fear that this is only the beginning of an insane lifelong fight to try and get the treatment that I need. At least alburterol is cheap, but all the rest of it is such a mess.

Not really sure what I'm hoping to get out of this post. I'm just scared and stressed about all of this.

93,"Last year in February, my dad came back from Florida, and had a bout of either pneumonia or bronchitis. He could not walk up a flight of stairs, and had some coughing, I think (I was at school at the time so I am not sure about the coughing though). After going to a walk-in clinic, they diagnosed him with one of the two infections (after listening to him breathing) and prescribed him with antibiotics. His symptoms were relieved after a couple of weeks. Two months later (in April), my family and I noticed that he had a pretty bad cough. We pleaded with him to get tested for COVID-19, which he did, and it came back negative. After that, I believe his cough somewhat got better because I, specifically, did not notice it, although I did notice it a few times during the summer though, but less when we were at our vacation home (he was away from allergic triggers- like his bed covered in my dog’s hair). After the summer, in September, was when I realized his cough is chronic. He has been coughing everyday now since then. I can’t tell if his cough is dry or wet. He sometimes will have a little cough and then other times he will cough a lot at once. His cough sounds pretty barky and wheezy, but it doesn’t sound like he brings up any mucus so I don’t think it is a productive cough. Otherwise, he has no other symptoms; no shortness of breath, no wheezing, no chest tightness, etc. 

Everytime I hear my dad cough and tell him that I am worried, he says it’s allergies, which could very well be true. He has extremely bad allergies (he is allergic to pollen, dust, and pet fur/dander); my dog sleeps with him every night and his bed is covered in fur and dander which just exacerbate his allergies more he says (he has red eyes waking up). His bedroom has a lot of dust in it too. He also has asthma and has used my siblings inhalers occasionally throughout the years. 

Also, my dad is 59 and pretty obese. He smokes cigars on occasion, and sometimes (but very infrequently) cigarettes, which don’t help the situation at all. He recently (last month) went in for a physical/check-up, and his doctor said everything is fine (except for his weight, which he said to work on). 

I, personally, am the biggest hypochondriac ever and think I have all of these life threatening illnesses. In September, my hypochondria switched over to my dad’s chronic cough (when it started to become chronic). I am so afraid that he has lung cancer, and I keep constantly looking up stories and signs with people who had it and it worries the shit out of me. I start thinking these are the last moments that I have with my dad, and that he is never going to see me and my siblings grow up. I also imagine him not being here anymore and it makes me cry every single time. I tell him to go see the doctor about it but he brushes it off every time, which just makes my anxiety even worse.

I’m also allergic to dogs but had dogs growing up and haven’t found them to trigger intense asthma (if at all, I’d have to be really playing with them or cuddling them.) that said my mom always kept the dogs out of my bedroom.

2,"27M. 67 kg. 180 cm. 

Some background: I was diagnosed with mild/moderate asthma about 1.5 years ago. It's been a long process of trial and error to find a medication regimen that works for me. I had tried a few different inhaled steroids over the past year but I found that they made my asthma worse (had a heavy chest and breathing felt pretty laboured). For the past 1.5 months, I have been taking Zenhale (2 puffs in the morning, 2 at night) and Singulair (10 mg at night) together and so far, this combination of meds has been working fairly well for me. I also been taking my peak flow readings for the past 1.5 months and they are usually around 600-610 L/min. I also haven't had to use my ventolin which I'm happy about. I also have seasonal allergies and allergic rhinitis, which I keep under control with Dymista, desloratadine, and daily sinus rinses.

About a week ago, I went outside for a walk in my neighbourhood and the next morning, I woke up with chest tightness which I've had ever since. I've also been a bit more congested in my nose and throat. Even though I'm taking all my meds, I'm chalking this up to allergies because I felt fine before going for my walk, but I'm concerned that these symptoms haven't gone away since I've stayed indoors ever since. I also keep my home clean by regularly dusting, vacuuming, washing bed sheets, etc. to minimize triggers. My peak flow readings have gone down a bit but are still fairly close to normal, usually around 580-600 L/min.

Does anyone here have experience with symptoms lasting for days after being exposed to allergens, and/or experience with allergy/asthma symptoms despite a relatively normal peak flow?

I should also note that my family and I rarely go out these days (I'm fortunate to be able to work from home) and I got my first covid vaccine about 3 weeks ago, so I doubt I have covid.

I have some questions belonging to Asthma or generally breathing issues.  I’ve been to a doctor and he checked my lungs. He couldn’t hear any strange noise coming from my lungs. 
He then sends me to a professional lung doctor. I go there by next week. 

Everything started when I moved to a new city. I got out of breath fast and started to cough in the morning. 
I also suffer from anxiety and think it makes my breathing worse. I think about every breath I take and focus on my breathing. 
Sometimes I feel like my chest is tight and I can't properly breathe. When I take my inhaler it does not do anything. 
I am allergic and some stuff is growing right now. But I don’t have typical signs like sneezing or itchy eyes. Also, my nose is not running. 
I have a dog and I am really scared that I am allergic to him now. But again, no signs of any allergic symptoms. 
My lungs don’t do any noise either. 

I am a smoker and scared I have COPD. This is unlikely cause the doctor didn’t hear anything. I have stopped smoking since then. 

Still, the coughing in the morning is there.

So I’ve had asthma since I was a small child. My doctors in my little home town were awful and told me to take spoonfuls of honey to cure my chronic cough. Unsurprisingly it didn’t work and I went years without getting proper treatment.

When I moved to a new town my asthma got much worse (probably from the dry and cold climate)  and the doctor I saw immediately recognized it as asthma after a few simple tests. I took daily corticosteroids, used a rescue inhaler (albuterol) when I had attacks, and a home nebulizer when it got really bad. After two years my doctor told me I didn’t have to take my daily inhaler and only needed to use my rescue one from then on. 

That was in 2008. I recently realized (only 13 years later) that I don’t know very much about the condition I’ve been living with. I’ve been having attacks more frequently in the last three years along with increasing chest pains. I have just been using albuterol when I have an attack like my old doctor recommended, but a PA at my PCP’s office told me everyone with asthma needs to take daily corticosteroids for the rest of their life now? 

I decided to do some research and I keep finding conflicting articles - some say rescue inhalers like albuterol can cause more inflammation in your lungs over time so you should take daily corticosteroids, some say you don’t need daily inhalers and rescue inhalers are better- I’m so confused and I feel like I should know this considering I have had asthma my whole life...

I am looking to know if anybody has experience on long term corticosteroids inhaler for asthma treatment. Been reading a lot about recently and would love to know if anybody has had any side effects or any considerations I should know before taking it

I've always had breathing issues in my childhood, but that was gone for years until now. Sadly on the last two months, I've been struggling to breathe and after a pulmonary test function I was diagnosed with asthma

My doctor is prescribing me an inhaler corticosteroid (not sure the dosage yet), and according to him, that will be something that I have to take my whole life. Of course, the word corticosteroids scared me a bit, after some research, I could see that there are lots of possible side effects (mostly from oral intake if I understood correctly but not sure)

41,"I had childhood asthma and thought I grew out of it. A couple years ago I mentioned to my doctor that it seems to have returned and she agreed that what I described was asthma. Since I didn't and still don't have medical insurance, she said since my asthma attacks weren't all that frequent and inhalers are expensive she didn't want to prescribe anything for it. As a child I used what I think was a nebulizer and since I have no clue what the medication in it was, she dismissed it completely.

I have always had pet allergies and have now been a parent to two cats I adore for 3 years.

Now tonight/this morning I've come to the realization that myself and my spouse lose a decent amount of sleep from times I wake up during the night unable to breathe. It's sometimes triggered just by drinking a couple sips of a cold beverage, exercise, and cold winter air. We've been treating it with vicks vapo rub and very hot tea which I inhale the steam from and then drink once it cools to a temp that just barely doesn't burn my mouth. I normally opt for mint and/or ginger for anti inflammatory purposes. It takes a few hours for me to be able to breathe okish again and even longer for the coughing to stop. We worry that my coughing can be heard in the apartment next to us as it's a very loud full chest rattling cough.

I chose my 1st steroid inhaler to be Alvesco (Ciclesonide) since it does not end up in the systemic circulation &amp; typically has very little side-effects. I stopped after 18 days due to unbearable side-effects that kept getting worse.  
 

I thought that Asmanex (Mometasone) has nearly no systemic circulation but apparently it’s roughly the same as Fluticasone in the amount ending up in the bodies systemic circulation (blood stream) according to this abstract I found doing a quick google search.

Does anyone know of any other inhalers where less of it ends up in the systemic circulation or are these my 2nd best options.

“New phlegm issue that *literally* will not go away after MONTHS

Hey everyone! I just wanted to reach out for some ideas on what could be the issue. Before I write, I have a pulmonologist, ENT and an allergy doc.

Okay so back in September 2020 my asthma really started to get out of control. I was on Breo 200/25 for maybe a year before this so my asthma was already a problem. I’ve been on steroid inhalers since I was like 5, I’m 25 now (f) and my asthma has only gotten worse since September. I had multiple asthma attacks in November and that sent me spiraling into this out of control issue where I constantly have to clear my throat because of phlegm build up. I’ve had 3 steroid shots since September 2020, been on 5 rounds of prednisone from the basic Z pack to 50mg. I went to the urgent care/ER center in January and had an x Ray, which came back clear. But given the symptoms of the plegm, persistent upper back pain and shortness of breath the doc diagnosed me with atypical pneumonia and sent me on my way with a 5 day dose of Azithromycin and 50mg prednisone. Nothing really changed, so my pulmonologist told me to try Trelegy and gave me a months worth of samples which I’m still using. (I can’t really tell a difference). I had maybe 3 good days after the course of antibiotics and steroids then the phlegm came back. So I told my primary and she sent me in for a CT of the chest. It came back and in my right lung I have about 5mm of a“Ground glass nodular opacity” (not Covid related). I freaked out because I thought there was a lump in my lung but I guess there isn’t? I don’t KNOW. So I followed up with my new pulmonary doctor 3 weeks after the first round of antibiotics and steroids he gave me a ten day dose of Avelox 400mg and now tomorrow is my last dose. I STILL HAVE THE PHLEGM ISSUE, though it’s not as bad as before. I just always sound like I’m about to make a damn speech OR my aunt who is a lifelong smoker with emphysema. It’s bad. 
I haven’t worked out in months because it’s hard to breathe and my asthma flairs up so easily. I’m now on the lowest dose of Trelegy 100/62.5/25 and off Allegra so my eosinophil count goes up so that I can try and qualify for Fasenra. (Update: my count doesn’t qualify me for the meds and I’m back on Breo 200/25)
Any ideas on what the heck could be the problem? I don’t smoke. I’m relatively healthy, 5’7, 135lbs. I’m writing this late at night so hopefully this post makes sense. I’m drinking golden milk powder with a plant based milk like every day. I’ve been eating healthier and I cut out obvious sugars. I finally got my first dose of the COVID 19 vaccine so I’m grateful for that. (Update: fully vaccinated)
I don’t know guys. I’m at a loss, and I can’t keep missing work for all of these doctors appointments and Google isn’t any help. I’m not saying I’ll take what y’all say as a diagnosis, but maybe if you have an idea just throw it out there and I’ll ask my doc if it could be a possibility. 

Thank you!”


UPDATE: 

I’m still completely fucked up. 58 days since I posted that and I’m terrified I might be a goner soon.
My pulmonologist might be an actual sociopath. I have an appointment with him this week coming up and a DIFFERENT pulmonologist the week after. 
I’ve been on a personal stash of 50mg prednisone for the past 8 days. Levalbuterol nebulizer 2x a day morning and night. Rescue inhaler as needed in between.oxygen levels are fine. No blue nails or lips. Phlegm won’t stop coming up. Coughing up crap every day. Lungs feel so heavy and back and diaphragm are so sore from trying to breathe. 
I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford a hospital because I’m in the USA. Even though I have good insurance. I’m afraid once I stop the prednisone that I will die. I’m afraid that if I stop taking the nebulizer I will die. It feels so scary. I’m afraid of a paradoxical bronchospasm. I imagine this is what countless Americans feel like. Having to choose because the hospital and dying. 
I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid. And so tired of being sick. I just want my life back.

72,"TLDR - doctor half listened to my concerns of Asthma, gave me an inhaler as a ""test"" but her lack of a definitive answer has me not using it because I am uncertain if it's all in my head or I actually have Asthma. 

Sorry for the long read- just want to make sure I give any and all info.

Hi! If anyone could chip in with their personal experience with Asthma, that would be great! So I (21F) finally got around to getting a primary care doctor for the first time since I was a kid. I am a big overthinker so I'm constantly google doctoring myself and then dismissing everything because I know I'm not a doctor. So instead of going to the doctor for my problems, I google it, often find something that sounds spot on, then dismiss it because I feel like a giant hypochondriac. I feel like my problems aren't legit unless I'm in constant pain and discomfort ot dying. I finally decided I should just get a doctor and go to them if I have any concerns, because duh, that's their job.

Anyways, on to the Asthma. I actually learned recently that it runs in the family a little which is what made me actually speak up and tell my doctor about my concerns. I think if I have it, it may be adult onset? I am a mouth breather and have cosginital r/anosmia (meaning no sense of smell ever)--just throwing this out there in case it is relevant. 

As long as I can remember, I have randomly had these yawn-attack things where I feel like I can't get a deep breath. It has always been extremely frustrating, I keep yawning very deeply trying to get a good breath in and it usually takes a while for me to finally get it and be satisfied. These have been increasing lately to multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day. I also often find myself having to remove my mask because I feel like I am struggling to get a good breath in (don't worry I only do it when I am in my own station at work, I am a baker) and this can happen randomly, when it gets hot?, after I pick up some 50 lb bags of flour, or when I go up and down stairs. 

I mentioned this to my doctor at my check up, I think we were talking about exercise, (and how I am always extremely tired, like sleeping 12-17 hours easy on my days off), and I mentioned how I am not great at it. Its not that I am extremely out of shape or anything, I've always struggled with exercising. Even when I was at my fittest in high school, doing cross country and track, I was awful at it. 

The only typical Asthma symptoms I've had is once when I was jogging in the cold, by the end of my short run I was wheezing and coughing every time I spoke, multiple times a minute for 4-5 hours until I went to bed.

My doctor ignored all my recent symptoms, zeroed in on that one time, and said it sounds like I have exercise induced Asthma and prescribed me an inhaler (but she put it on me, saying she can perscribe it IF I WANTED IT. I was like, well do you think I NEED IT??) She said to use it before exercise, but the thing is, I don't really exercise. I have a very active job and have a pretty normal body and am haply with where it is and have no motivation for it, which I told her.

So basically, I haven't used it. I keep having instances where I think I should, but I don't because I feel like she didn't officially diagnose me with Asthma. As I said, I've been having the air hunger/ deep yawning more and more often, and have been having it on and off for the last 24 hours which is what finally pushed me to ask here. I am now laying in bed excessively yawning trying to get a good one in, and my chest and throat are pretty tight. 

So reddit, what say you? Do I have it? Should I use the inhaler? Am I overthinking?

I don't know if allergies have anything to do with this also or not, but I am allergic to latex. I've recently discovered I'm allergic to bananas and might be allergic to a bit more food (but I'm extremely picky and haven't tried lots of them). I get the standard seasonal allergies, probably allergic to mold and definitely allergic to hay. Allergic to dogs, sadly. Grew up with them my whole life and would get hives and sometimes runny nose and eyes but didn't care. Moved away at 18 and every time I go to visit, my allergies are progressively worse.

I’ll get an “attack” every once in a blue moon where it gets really bad for maybe a few minutes with the very sharp pain and unable to take any kind of deep breath because of the pain. It usually lasts under 5minutes, but this time went on for about 10. This time the pain radiates to my back directly behind my lungs, this is a first and even more annoying. 

Concerning, but at this point it hasn’t killed me yet so I could be more worried. However it’s still *very* annoying since it’s not always the worse pain, but a chronic ache or sharp pain that’s more manageable.

Am I alone in this progressing mystery condition? Considering the asthma type symptoms + the chest pain, my only guess at this point is asthma.

80,"Over the the last 4 months I've had to stop exercising (I do calisthenics and, when gyms are open—and safe—hybrid weightlifting) because of problems at home, health, and then for a surgery. Over this time I've lost substantial muscle (in comparison to times of hiatus in the past). At first it didn't seem like anything, but I've lost 3 inches off my arms and who knows how many off my chest. 

My pulmonologist says that since I'm older (early 30s) that TRT is probably the only option, but this isn't an option because corticosteroidal treatment worsens bipolar mania (we had to raise my mood stabilizer dose), and Breo has already caused this and prednisone gave me heart problems. He also feels that because Breo is only inhaled it should only go to my lungs, in affecting my health.

Are there ANY ways that r/asthma can recommend that at least slow down this wasting now that I can exercise again?

I looked into Ursolic Acid but it apparently interferes with digesting my bipolar medication. Before this illness brought me down, training was my only way of managing my mental disorder.

So about a month ago I started on this really bad asthma exacerbation that’s kept me from going back to work. The worst part is I just started this job and I was beginning to really like it and now I had to take a break because of uncontrollable asthma.  


Now a month later I’ve got more meds (prednisone and symbacort) and it’s looking like next week I should be OK enough to go back. And yet I’m incredibly anxious about it, I keep thinking that I’m going to forget everything that I did and make a lot of mistakes at work. Despite my boss being really nice and my coworkers being really nice I keep thinking that they all think I am weak in someway.

I'm hoping someone here can give me an opinion. And yes, I know reddit is not a doctor, but this isn't exactly an emergency so I'd like a second opinion before I book an appointment!

Ever since I was a kid, cardio like running or biking has caused my chest to start hurting and feeling tight. I feel it in my chest and sometimes my lower throat. It is always the first part of my body to ""get tired"" from exercise and it made me hate games like tag as a kid.

I always thought this was normal and just a sign that I'm out of shape. In fact, I use it to indicate that I'm getting a good workout.

However, when casually mentioning it to my boyfriend, he was confused and shocked and told me that it is certainly not normal. I insisted that he is just in better shape than me and this is why it doesn't happen to him but he said he has never experienced what I describe.

Just 2 days ago I went on a bike ride and pushed myself up a steep hill. My throat and chest was KILLING me and my chest still hurts today mostly when I laugh. I was coughing a bit yesterday but not the moment of.

Except for this one instance I don't usually cough from it. I can breathe fine and deep but it hurts to do so. I don't really wheeze but if I move my chest a certain way I weeze slightly.

I'm a 25 year old female. I'm fairly active and do cardio 3-5 times a week for about 30 minutes. Up until recently, I would push myself until the chest pain because I thought it was good for me lol.

I've gone through phases of recreational smoking to going 6 months with no smoking in my 20's and early 30's. 

In the last 90 days, I've been smoking bong rips three times a day.  I know, I know...I have my own reasons. 

This weekend, I quit cold turkey.  Finally. 

Anyways - prior to the last 90 days, my Asthma would only flair up at night, before bed...every other day.

I used one puff of Advair at 250mg - and lived life normally.  Also, if I needed to do cardio - I definitely need a puff then too. 

Other than that - I do not use Albuterol.  I develop an extremely quick dependency on it, where it becomes increasingly ineffective, while my lungs worsen. 

Fast Forward to the last 90 days.  I've basically been upping my Advair to every night, while still smoking three times a day.  

My symptoms are simple.

In the morning I clear phlegm. But more than that, I'm having difficulty breathing due to wheezing during the day (where before it was only at night...and even then it was every other night). 

I'm on day 4 of being clean.  I'm still feeling the symptoms though.  I know that since I punished my lungs for 3 months, it's probably going to take that much time and more to recover...

However, I can help but still feel anxious in the mean time, by constantly struggling to breath during the day, without prematurely using my 'night puff' of Advair.

If so, what does recovery look like?

I’ve been living with asthma all my life (31f) and I’ve been using both Qvar and salbutamol as long as I can remember. My regular doctor is on maternity leave and the replacement changed my Qvar to Symbicort. 

When I picked up my prescription, I asked the nurse to give me more information about my mew meds and she didn’t do a very good job. (that’s a whole other story). Anyway. I have opened up the inhaler and it’s a contraption I’ve never seen, I don’t know how it works (I’m going to research further how it works).

30,"Hi everybody, hope you’re all well.  I’m a patient transporter at a local hospital, which was a job that was going well for quite awhile, until the night after a shift I experienced the worst asthma attack in years. Extreme chest tightness, muscle fatigue, the whole nine yards. As such, I’ve been out of work while trying to get a handle on this.  

Granted I suppose I could’ve taken more initiative on this but it is so debilitating. I’m thankfully finally going to see a lung doctor about it tmrw.   However, a major problem I’ve been dealing with is how others have been viewing my sickness.  I get varying degrees of understanding but I also get a lot of “Well you sound fine” and “you shouldn’t be sick this long.”  My own dad is guilty of this and I get so frustrated that I want to shake him and tell him that it’s fucking hard to do anything when you can’t breathe properly. It’s been taking such an extreme toll on my mental health. I’m just thankful I’ve a nurse mom who understands. 

Medication wise I’ve been on  a lot of Albuterol to combat it. Some days it’s manageable, and some days it’s kicking my ass. I’ve gotten two covid negatives thankfully but again I haven’t felt this bad in a very very long time and this whole thing has really crashed and burned my self esteem.

Background: I'm 24, an asthmatic and whenever I get a cold - I almost always end up with a severe respiratory infection. I'm on Seretide two puffs twice a day, and dymista nasal spray twice a day. I was diagnosed with asthma at the start of 2019.

  
I'm a second year teacher in Australia. In 2019 I worked for 7 months as a teacher's aide in a medium sized secondary school. I got sick about 6-7 times, antibiotics 5-6 times and ended up with pneumonia. Later in the year I ended up in the ER with another bout of bronchitis.

  
I've been at a new school since the start of 2020; being in lockdown in my city for half of the year meant I got through almost the whole of last year without a cold. But last week I had to miss the entire final week of term due to a respiratory infection (9 days later and still no end in sight).   
Whenever I get sick I also get so anxious about it (because I know it always ends with a severe infection) which makes my asthma worse, creating a vicious cycle.

  
I absolutely love my job and can't imagine doing anything else (and I feel like I could be really good at it!!), but I'm also worried about the toll on my physical health (and the flow on effect to my mental health).  My contract ends at the end of 2020 and I am considering a couple of options, including trying to get work at a smaller school, or finding education-related work outside of the classroom.

**How I caught it:**

My wife had to travel in the train recently and she had noticed that her seat / windows etc were very dusty. She caught a cough by the time she reached home which developed into a fever.

4 days after that I caught a cough as well. And immediately felt lathargic as well. 4 days have passed after that.

**Duration of viral fever:** Since the last 4 days.

I caught a viral fever with cough. I suspected that it might be covid and immediately proceeded to take the following medicines:

**Medicine already taken:**

* Azithromycin (500 X 3 tablets = finished the doze night before yesterday)
* Zincovit (multi-vitamin)
* Vitamin C
* Dolo 650 / paracetamol (for fever)

This combination resulted in absolutely no changes in terms of fever or cough! I had had covid earlier and this same medicine had killed covid for me. Hence, I suspect that this time it's an ordinary viral fever.

**Currently taking the following medicines:**

* Dolo 650 / paracetamol (for fever) - twice a day because the fever keeps coming back.

**Current symptoms + what I've been doing:**

I've got a strange dry cough. I cough on ocassion. Not too much. It feels like there's mucus lodged in the throat which is ""raspy"" and also mucus stuck somewhere deeper inside which doesn't come out. Besides that there's a slight lathargic feeling.

I've been:

* gargling multiple times
* taking steam inhalation
* drinking hot water
* sipping hot soup
* sipping lozenges

All these seem to make little to no difference to the mucus that's stuck deeper inside.

&amp;#x200B;

**The main problem occurs when I lie down to sleep.** It feels like my chest is getting squeezed no matter what position I sleep in. Breathing becomes an effort and I feel like I have to forcefully inhale / exhale. This makes it difficult to fall asleep.As I continue to lie down the wheezing becomes stronger and stronger resulting in the need to cough.

If I get up into a seating posture it's all fine. I can breathe normally. But if I lie down sideways I feel like I'm having to put effort in inhalation/exhalation.

Was curious to hear if anyone here has a similar presentation and may have any advice to share. My asthma has the following characteristics:

1. Chronic burning sensation when breathing and shortness of breath worsened by talking for a moderate amount of time (&gt;30 mins), inhalation of strong scents or smoke, or acute stress
2. No acute “attacks”. Never need to use an albuterol inhaler (in fact it irritates my lungs). If triggered by any of the above, lungs will tighten up for days or even weeks. No exercise intolerance - have completely normal cardiovascular stamina and regularly exercise
3. Significant difficulties sleeping. Frequent apneas and sleep paralysis, most notably between 2-6AM. I wake up between 2-5AM most days. During sleep paralysis, I can clearly feel the shortness of breath. Before asthma, I slept a solid 7 hours every night straight through. I have a relatively high-intensity career so the sleep deprivation is quite difficult to deal with 
4. Most spirometry readings are normal or close to normal. Only result I’ve seen a bit further outside of the normal range is the residual air left in the lungs after exhalation (excess air trapped in lungs).
5. Has not responded to any treatments thus far. I am seeing a pulmonologist and a GI. I’ve been on an increasing course of steroids (now on long acting ICS and LABA), and pulmonologist wants to further increase dosage. However, I’m skeptical seeing as steroids haven’t had a discernible benefit this far. Also on a PPI (this seems to have had a bit of an effect in decreasing burning sensation when breathing but no material effect on sleeping or preventing flare-ups). I eat a strict diet to prevent heartburn as much as possible and reflux currently feels under control.

65,"20/M/5'7""/135 lbs, Southeast Asian. Non smoker, no alcohol (ever, for both besides maybe some second hand exposure). Pretty fit generally, cycling and running frequently. Never had asthma before.


I have had a lingering dry cough for quite some time, it was barely noticeable before but got a little worse around mid January this year. I thought it was related to acid reflux as I've got a lot of mucus and feel the need to clear my throat. I had a life-changing test beginning of Feb that was extremely stressful over 2 days and that made it worse, I had failed that test before and you get 3 lifetime attempts. Thankfully I did manage to pass the second time.



Previously over the phone around mid Feb I described my symptoms to my doctor and she prescribed me Pantoprazole for 2 weeks, and gave me a nasal spray (Omnaris) + sinus rinse which I had been taking. I got better for 2 weeks and then went back to how it was before and the spray didn't help after even though I'd be taking it daily. 



Went to a walk in clinic 4 days ago because my family doctor is away for another 2 weeks and just so I could get referred to a specialist/find out more, doctor wrote down an X-Ray to rule out a hernia which I got done right away and a blood test (H pylori, eGFR, Alk. Phosphatase + ALT and I haven't gotten the blood test done yet, lab reopens Monday). 

Later I got a call that she found my X Ray revealed some bronchitis and that would explain my cough. No pneumonia. Prescribed me 2 inhalers (Ventolin HFA (Salbutamol) and Alvesco (Ciclesonide)) + an Antibiotic (Cefprozil). I have been taking them for 2 days now and I don't really notice an improvement. The first time I took Ventolin (never had inhalers before but I had bronchitis as a kid) it felt like it relaxed my lungs almost instantly but now it doesn't feel like it does anything. I'm using the inhaler properly too according to a video on YouTube. I believe she said chronic bronchitis which google said is a form of COPD? I'm really hoping not as I don't feel obstructed in breathing but the cough is really annoying.



So I'm just wondering if this shows that there's something else that's wrong or if it just sounds like bronchitis. This cough is completely dry and is worse in the mornings, but gets a bit better throughout the day. The cough itself never brings up mucus but I feel the need to clear my throat almost constantly and phlegm is light yellow in colour sometimes, but pretty often it's clear. I have a little bit of wheezing when I breathe out fast with a bit of a tickle and irritation in my lungs. I'm still able to exercise and run no problem, just with some irritation. Mornings I have a bit of nausea with the cough, gets better later. 



The Ventolin is prescribed for 25 days, Cefprozil for 10, and the Alvesco for 60. I'm just hoping that my lungs can heal from this and the cough goes away completely real soon. In 2018 October I travelled to Pakistan for 2 weeks where the air pollution was really bad, not sure if it affects anything.



Main reason I'm worried is because I'm at the end stages of my military pilot application process and they asked me if I had taken inhalers hours before I got told I had bronchitis. I had never up til that point. I need to do lung function testing and more ECG and Corneal X rays as part of the medical process once I get accepted, and they ask for inhaler usage. I've never had asthma before either. Just hoping this won't cause any permanent damage to me and I can recover from this soon.

I've always been prone to chest infections because of my asthma. I had bronchitis almost every year as a child, and one really bad bout of pneumonia when I was twelve. In my 20's it seemed to improve.

But this year was bad.

In October I had pneumonia. Then in November it relapsed into bronchitis. December was pneumonia again in the other lung. After that, my lungs haven't recovered. I feel like I can never catch a full breath, I can't breath through all the mucus. I had to quit singing lessons. I can hardly ever walk my dog anymore. I have a constant wet cough that isn't helped with antibiotics, prednisone, singulair, or any of my puffers.

I feel like I'm slowly drowning. And my family doctor says my left lung is starting to fill with mucus again, even with the Aerobika breathing machine.

Does anyone have ANY advise on how to clear the mucus? I am trying to see a respirologist, but I've been waiting since December, and I finally got an appointment for next month, but it's over the phone, which isn't going to help.

82,"TLDR at bottom

I went to the ER 2 months ago for asthma and was diagnosed with pneumonia. I got a rescue inhaler called Proair and it was small but worked well. In the past I had blue Ventolin inhalers I purchased OTC in Mexico that worked way better than this one for some reason. They also gave me 60mg of prednisone to take for a week and antibiotics for a week. I went to an urgent care a few days after for a COVID19 test and the NP there while examining me prescribed me a nebulizer and liquid albuderol, and had me do that 2 times a day for a week and to use it as needed after that. I ran out of my inhaler last week and I had to start using my nebulizer again, probably twice daily for 3 minutes at a time using .6 mg of liquid albuderol. I am on Medicaid in my state, and therefore there aren’t a lot of doctors that take my insurance. The one doctor I found didn’t call me when I had a telemedicine appointment scheduled and that was the second time they’ve stood me up that way. I need a new doctor but the nearest appointment at the other doctor near me that takes my insurance is 2 weeks out and I don’t have a lot of money due to not being able to work much so I can’t really pay for a private doctor. I can barely stand and play my instrument right now due to pain and asthma has now ruled it out. I stopped smoking cannabis a week ago and now I’m just in pain because I limit myself to 2 opioids a day. (Really addicting) I caved yesterday and smoked some cannabis, and used my nebulizer 20 minutes after due to coughing. How often can I use a nebulizer in a day, and how much liquid albuderol is safe? Will I have to give up smoking until I can see a new doctor and get new meds.

84,"Hi Everyone, Im new to this group and looking for some advice, and always happy to help others in anyway i can too.

So I have some form of asthma, but not the typical, wheezing and shortness of breath kind. What I get is just a very inflamed feeling behind my chest wall, in my airway, usually right in the middle of sternum. I feel it when I breathe in as the air goes down. Its usually just a small area that I can almost pinpoint on my chest with my finger. 

My doctor believes the probably cause of this is first of all, I have a deviated septum, so I tend to breathe thru my mouth more than my nose. And also, Ive been doing a lot of outdoor distance running during this pandemic and with the colder weather, and breathing heavily, mainly thru my mouth as I run, its letting a lot of cold unfilted air down my airway thats inflaming the lining of my airways.

Does this make sense to the folks here in this group? And if so, what is the best way to manage it? I was given an inhaler, (symbicort) to see if it helps with the inflammation. But Im having a hard time using it properly to ensure its getting down in my lungs. 

I also have reflux/gerd, and the doctor told me that often times acid from the esophagus can spill into the airways as well.

87,"Just wanted to put this out there. I have been trying to solve my worsening asthma symptoms for just over 5 years now. In winter of 2015 I developed a chest cough that lasted 8 months. Finally solved it by aggressively treating my allergies as it was caused by incessant post-nasal drip. 

But my asthma was still bothering me every day after that. Went to a pulmonologist for the first time in my life and tried Advair (all strengths), Breo, QVAR (which helped the least by far), Symbicort, and Dulera. I ended up sticking with Dulera for the past 3 years (200mcg, 2 puffs twice a day). For the past 3 years my daily regimen of medication has been Dulera, Azelastine, Allegra, Singulair, and occasionally Flonase. On top of all that I was still needing to use my rescue inhaler at least once a day. 

Long story short, my insurance switched over and I was forced to find another maintenance inhaler. Pulm prescribed Trelegy as it was recently approved to treat asthma, and holy fucking shit. I can finally breathe during the day consistently. Only times I ever need my rescue inhaler now are when I exercise, spend time around concentrated triggers, or when my GERD acts up. 

My lungs seriously haven't felt this open since I was a kid. I also started double-dosing Flonase (at my pulmonologists request) and my post-nasal drip has finally almost completely disappeared. Now all I take is Trelegy once a day, Singulair and night, and Flonase twice a day.

11,"I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this: severe chest pain when using a rescue inhaler? 

As a child, I was diagnosed with exercised induced asthma and given a rescue inhaler to use when experiencing asthma symptoms whenever I participated in sports, which would trigger the attack. 

I found that whenever I used the rescue inhaler I could suddenly breathe, yay, but it came at a steep price. Every time I used the inhaler, I would feel a severe pain in my chest, almost like a burning sensation from extreme cold. It’s hard to explain, but it’s a terrible pain and feels ice like. Didn’t matter when I used the inhaler either, it would happen when I used the inhaler prior to the asthma attack as a preventative or during the asthma attack. As a child, I didn’t think much of it and thought it was normal because I didn’t know any better. My solution was to I try to avoid having to use my rescue inhaler, because not being able to breathe, while terrifying, was more bearable than the pain I’d experience when I’d use the inhaler. I essentially avoided all gym activities and sports. 

Fast forward to being an adult, I had learned to manage my asthma by avoiding high intensity activities and by managing my asthma attacks during exercise...like stopping the exercise before the point of being completely unable to breathe, or lowering the intensity when I noticed the beginning of wheezing, etc. 

I ended up getting a prescription for another rescue inhaler when I got serious about running and I didn’t want to have to avoid triggers. I used the rescue inhaler a couple of times and again experienced the insane chest pain I remembered I’d get as a kid. And once again, avoided using the inhaler despite  panicking several times when I’d push myself to the point of being barely able to breathe during a run. I know, I sound crazy...

Now as an adult, I figured something wasn’t right and this wasn’t a normal response to the rescue inhaler. I googled chest pain and apparently it’s a side effect where you should immediately stop the use of the medication and speak to your doctor. I believe I was always prescribed albuterol. I still haven’t talked to my doctor, but plan on doing it some day.

It has worked well as a rescue medicine with me being put on a nebulizer only on 2 occasions in the past 10 years. 

Recently, I have been starting to notice its side effects and is bothering me whenever I do cardio. Since the lockdown, there has been an increase in construction activities around my house and I am being exposed to more dust. Naturally, the frequency of my inhaler intake has also increased (roughly 2-3 times a week now). The following are the side effects I am sure are caused by my inhaler:

* Increase in heart rate (especially troublesome when I go for a run)
* Drowsiness

Side effects I am not sure is solely caused by the inhaler:

* Decrease in bone density and joint instability (I broke my arm in 2014 from a relatively simple fall)
* Weak immune system 
* Excessive fat storage around stomach and thighs
* Excessive hair loss in the past year

But it's so often now that there's just this constant tightness in my chest that even a 3x dose of albuteral can't help. Once I sleep im fine, but it's getting harder to actually get to sleep with the constant ya know, not being able to take a full breath ever.

I stayed up all last night except for a few lucky hours because of this, almost drove myself to the hospital.

For the last 3 months I have been having symptoms pretty consistent with asthma, and it's giving me anxiety because I'm not sure: tickling in my lungs, recurring dry and sometimes wheezy cough with occasional clear phlegm, feeling like something is in my lungs, shortness of breath when doing things that never used to seem difficult like climbing lots of stairs, and lately I've been losing my voice if I talk too often. The tickle never really goes away. The chest tightness seems to have been flaring up on and off for the last few months.

I've tested negative for Covid four times recently, and have no other symptoms like sore throat, fever, congestion, or anything that would seem like an infection. I don't feel tired or have itchy eyes or sneeze as if I'm reacting to allergens, either. By coincidence I had to have my heart scanned with ultrasound and an EKG recently as well to see if I had a congenital issue from my father, and nothing abnormal came up there.

At the start of the symptom onset, my doctor said I have acute bronchitis (from a phone appointment) and told me to wait it out. It seemed to not be as painful after about two weeks so I figured it was passing. Then it came back in my lungs, or flared up, not sure how to describe - and when I called again he said it's possible to have two back to back infections, especially in winter, and to wait it out again. He gave me a salbutamol inhaler. I used it a few times a month ago when my chest felt particularly tight, but to be honest I didn't notice a difference. 

The irritated tight tickle flared up a third time two weeks ago. It has been pretty consistently irritated this time around, and the salbutamol seemed to do nothing again. My doctor still hasn't seen me in person due to Covid precaution, but he told me it might be either asthma or lower respiratory pneumonia. He prescribed Flovent as well as antibiotics, and told me to try the Flovent twice a day for a week, and if that doesn't work, then try the antibiotics afterwards. I've been on Flovent diligently for about five days, and haven't noticed any change, except that my voice seems to crackle and go more often. No signs of thrush, as I have been gargling and brushing my teeth afterwards.

I'm nervous that I'm developing asthma because I'm worried about keeping my dog. He's a husky. Yes, he sheds like a husky. I've had him for three years with no symptoms, except a couple hives if he drools excessively on me, which only happened twice. I've taken many precautions to try to minimize the chance of my allergies getting worse: HEPA filter in the bedroom, no carpets, minimal fabric furniture, vacuuming daily with a HEPA vacuum while wearing a mask, wiping dust away frequently, mopping floors, allergen mattress and pillow covers,  you name it. My husband does the dirty work like teeth brushing and grooming. My allergist still believes that my dog has something to do with it, especially because my reaction to dairy got worse last year. I'm skeptical because he never makes me itchy or sneezy or cough, even if I pet him or play (I still try to do this sparingly though). Also I believe I had other allergen exposures last year, such as dairy powders at my work and the instance of mold in one of my house plant pots 9 months ago. Not to mention how often I had gotten sick with a cold, so my immune system has been taxed.

Now I'm trying to think if I had other specific triggers for the flare ups, like cold air exposure, exercise, stress, or pollen, or accidental allergens in food, but nothing comes to mind. Other than my persistent anxiety over the constriction in my lungs, nothing out of the ordinary. It started in the dead of winter, so pollens are not likely, especially when all my houseplants are allergy safe species. Might this just be the inevitable result of slow dander exposure over time? 

I guess my main questions for you guys, who are more familiar with adult asthma than me are: do you think it's likely to be asthma, or something else? Do you think I can manage these symptoms and keep my dog, if my dog has something to do with it? How long does it take to notice the effects of Flovent? Anything else I should try?

76,"23M. Hey guys, new poster here. I've had asthma since I was a baby.  
To give a little background, I remember getting sick quite often when i was a kid, and having to use a nebulizer, especially when i was sick. I started carrying a rescue inhaler on me when i was 13, and starting taking Singulair when i was 15. I was on Singulair until i was about 17, which was when I started Qvar. Qvar worked better and made my Asthma almost non-existent, but when I was 20 I was changed over to Flovent, which, while it still works, isnt quite as effective as Qvar for me.  


Triggers- Dust, Pollen, and Animal dander have always been my main triggers. Pollen was an especially bad one in the past, mostly when i was 12 and younger, but nowadays, dust and animal dander seem to be my main triggers. Exercise or intensive labor can cause symptoms, mainly wheezing, but those don't last as long and usually get better shortly after take quick inhaler puff and sit and rest. Illnesses and Smoke are kinda hit or miss- Sometimes my asthma acts up more when im sick, sometimes it doesnt. Same with smoke- we had some bad wildfire smoke in my area this last summer, but I was hardly affected. Yet, one time a couple years ago I smoked a couple of cigarettes at a party because my vape ran out (I wasnt exactly sober either, lol), and I was wheezy for the next 12 hours or so after.  


Symptoms- while I've definitely had some bad exacerbations in the past, especially before high school, they are pretty rare nowadays. I honestly dont even remember the last time i had a notable attack. Usually, the only symptoms I have are mild wheezing and sometimes mild SOB at night and in the morning. I do have an occasional cough and oftentimes have mucus, mainly earlier in the day, although, that might be tied more to the fact that I'm a vaper. I dont usually get symptoms during the day unless I've been around a trigger, and even then, it's usually just wheezing and mild SOB which is usually kept at bay with 1 or 2 inhaler puffs.  


Medicine Use- Im on Flovent 110mcg, directed to take 2 puffs twice a day. But, I will admit, it's more often just two puffs per day taken at night, mainly due to the fact that Im a total zombie in the morning whose only focus is the acquisition and consumption of caffeine, so i often forget to take my first dose. However, if i am sick thats when I usually focus more on getting the full dosage in, for a little extra protection. So, 220mcg per day is my normal dosage of Flovent.  
I also have an albuterol inhaler, which I often take a single puff of before bed and when i wake up to stave off the nighttime/morning wheeziness, but during the day I rarely need it, unless ive been around a trigger, which then I might end up taking a couple puffs during the day. But this doesnt happen very often. Honestly, part of me feels like my med use is more for ""comfort"" than necessity, as Im usually just using it to stave off minor wheezing or SOB, but, ive forgot to refill my Flovent before running out in the past, and even with my forgetful ass only taking it at half dosage most of the time, symptoms, mostly wheezing, do become more frequent when that happens.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry about the wall of text, I wanted to get as much info in as I could for you guys. Now that ive written this out, it actually seems like my case is fairly mild, especially now, but I'd like a second opinion if i can get one.

It took multiple ER, urgent care and doctor’s visits. Broke a rib during 8th month of pregnancy from coughing. I always thought that was a myth but it does happen.
Once I had my baby, the occurrence of pneumonia was less often but finally got a pulmonary test and was diagnosed with asthma.

I went home around thanksgiving, had a mild cold (not COVID, tested three times), and my parents had gotten a new dog which as it turns out I'm allergic to. Starts having bad shortness of breath and coughing, so I went to the doctor who said it was just a nasty lung infection and gave me an albuterol inhaler and singulair. This has worked somewhat well, but even after leaving home and going back to school (away from the dog), I've continued to have shortness of breath (no other symptoms really, but it gets worse after exercise). I stopped taking the singulair when I ran out, and it got much worse, so I went back on it. Did a course of prednisone too which didn't help much.

86,"For a bit of context, I'm 25 years old and my mum has asthma. I began suspecting something wasn't right in October last year when I first became breathless while cycling back from my doctor (only about 10 minutes), to the point I nearly fainted afterwards, but I initially pinned it down to the fact I'd just had a blood test. 

Later in December my employer told me to go home and take a Covid test because I was coughing/really short of breath which of course came back negative. I first contacted my doctor about this round about January after another failed cycling attempt that left me gasping and dizzy. Because of Covid they couldn't test me in the office so they gave me a peak flow test to do a few times a day, concluded I was probably asthmatic from that and prescribed me a reliever inhaler. 

A couple weeks later I tried to cycle to work after taking my inhaler before setting off, ended up having to stop part way through to take it again, and still had to get off my bike and walk the rest of the way. I called my doctor again and was prescribed a reliever which I've been taking for a few weeks now. Last week, as I was leaving my job, I had to retrieve my bike that I'd left in the storage area and cycle home, and it didn't go any better than the last couple attempts.

My industry is one where overtime work is common. However, the job I’m currently in has perfect work life balance, no overtime required. I have been there for almost 6 years. 

I am earning $1200-1500 less than industry average. 

I have a 2nd upper honours degree from a local university.

I have tried to ask HR during job interviews about overtime but usually they either say something generic or don’t answer the question properly. I guess I won’t know for sure until I join the company. It will either be tolerable or intolerable for my health, I won’t know until I join. 

Should I just take the risk and change jobs? Then see if my health can take it. The problem is, if it doesn’t work out well, I’ll be job hopping on to another job again. If I keep changing job, it looks bad for resume too. I want to stay in my next job for longer. 

And also i just got married and might be starting a family soon, not sure if I can cope with poor health, demanding job, and baby. Not sure if it’s a good time to change jobs.

To add another vaccine-related thread.

I've now had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine.

My asthma has been absolutely terrible for the past few weeks. Weird as it's usually fairly well controlled and I even added Singulair on top of my daily inhaler to try manage.

The exacerbation coincides roughly with when I got the first vaccine.

I am fortunate enough to get my Covid vaccine tomorrow. I have moderate to severe asthma and I’m getting moderna.

I am on symbicort two puffs twice a day and Montelukast once a day for asthma, along with other medications for allergies as my asthma is mostly allergy-induced. I have coughing spasms at night that turn into asthma attacks, about once every 3-4 weeks now. 

I get my flu shot annually and have no known allergies to vaccines, if that helps. 

I’m mostly worried about a pulmonary issue. I think I can handle flu like symptoms like aches and pains, headaches, slight fever and chills. I have my epsom salt for baths, bed and days off, and trusty books for hiding out if I feel terrible but I don’t think I’ll feel anxious about an attack for that stuff.

What makes me suspect it's allergies: my throat is kind of sore, I'm sneezing a bit, and it came on kind of suddenly.

My questions:

a) Are antihistamines ever used as an adjunct treatment in asthma, including in addition to a leukotriene blocker like Singulair?

b) Does Singulair typically cover all allergic asthma or are there instances in which you'd also need an antihistamine?

95,"So I had moderate Asthma as a kid, (had my first attack when I was young) through high school. For a few years I didn't need to use my inhaler and had forgotten about the asthma (except when I run). However just very recently I've been having issues again.

My asthma (least from middle-high school) caused me to constantly cough up mucus. Plus the general feeling of tightness in chest and after a long day of coughing my lungs were feel ""warm"" and basically tired.  I did finally get it managed with a short term, and long term inhalers/plan and evidently forgot about it when I thought I didn't need it any more. Since I was cough/symptom free for a few years. 

Also note, I was a smoker (cigarettes) for like 4-5 years but did manage to quit a year ago. Haven't smoked since.

NOW: recently I was waking up at night having trouble breathing, I would feel like I wasnt getting enough air and would feel *slight* discomfort in my chest/throat. Felt tight or something. This only happened at night, when I would wake up. However now it's happening just when I'm trying to go to bed (makes it harder for me to fall asleep) AND general chest/breathing discomfort during the day. I can still breathe full breathes BUT the act of breathing feels slightly off, and my chest feel slightly tight.

* A deep ache at the lower back part of my head/skull. This occurs when my asthma attack is at it's worst point, before I've taken my medicine.
* If my asthma attack is extremely bad, sometimes deep inside my ears will hurt. (And sometimes my bottom back teeth/molars will ache. Although this one happens very rarely.)
* Sometimes it feels as if my eyes are going cross eyed. I'm not sure how else to describe it other than it feeling like my eyes are physically trying to look at the space between them.
* Once my breathing starts becoming easier, the pain from the back of my head moves to my temples. This pain feels more like a headache rather than a deep ache. Sometimes this pain will eventually move more towards my brow/eye region.
* The bluish/purplish discoloration of my fingernails always seems to come after my breathing is back under control (it doesn't happen during the asthma attack). Is anyone else like this?
* After my breathing is under control, sometimes I feel incredibly cold. To the point where I'm shaking and my teeth start chattering.

So I have bipolar 1. I was in heavy psyciatric care for 6 years, had an entire team i would see at least 1 time a month. I had an initial diagnoses of psychosis. I had a nurse, a metabolic doctor, a psychiatrist,

as well as a social worker.

I have been out of the care of tat team for 3 years and just got a medical doctor, I am also diagnosed as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and generalised anxiety disord

I recently had a breathing issue flair up and its hard for me to know if my new doctor is just being careful sending me to so many different appointments or if it is a need for concern. I cleaned a bachelor house for three days and got into mouse piss and shit as well as mouse shit and piss stains, dog hair, insane dust build up as well as everyting else you can expect in a house that hasnt been cleaned for 3 years.

The doctor gave me a rescue puffer then a maintenence steroid puffer, then a nasal spray, now antibiotics. Then booked me for a CT scan, now she refeared me to a respretory specialist that I have not even talked to and now she has asked tat specialist to refear me to a doctor and as told me he may

want a lung biopsy... so wtf am i suppost to expect? As soon as I told her i smoke she has seemed fixated on that as the cause but i have only been smoking for 4 years! Its not like i am a 60 or 80 year old wo as been smoking 50+ years.

I sent her a message expressing my concern about how this has excellated from rescue puffer- rescue puffer+ maintenence puffer- rescure puffer+ maintence puffer+ nasal spray and antibioticsm- a respritory terapist- a respretory doctor who may or may not want a biopsy!

Because of covid it scares me of course but I do have asthma and also don't have a fever or cough or anything.

It also doesn't hurt when I cough. 


To add: yesterday I felt like I had a bit of a struggle breathing. Nothing to alarming but it felt like it feels when you go into cold water or take a cold shower and just get short of breath. It wasn't only for a moment but the whole evening though.


Another thing: it especially hurts at a point of my right lower ribs but not my whole ribcage. I used a fascia roll yesterday since my upper back is always tense, so maybe that could be the cause. 


Is that my asthma or should I be worried?
(sorry if the wording is weird, English isn't my first language)


A little update: pretty sure it's because of the fascia roll and/or over all back tension since it doesn't really hurt anymore while breathing (still a little but then again...

I'm a 27 yo male with Asthma and, admittedly, since I was younger until recently my Asthma was very well managed. I used to live in the southeast USA. I was athletic and active and always outside - my asthma was really mild. I even did a full Ironman and didn't really have much asthma trouble before or afterward.

In the years since then, my asthma was fine until I moved to Boston a few years ago. I've found that, given the colder winters, my asthma has been far worse.

At this point in the ambulance I can’t feel my hands or my face, as they were tingling like crazy. Paramedics quickly put the albuterol nebulizer in my mouth and as I stared at the doors I was seriously wondering if I was going to make it. Once in the ER, they strap me in for the hour long nebulizer and run some other tests; covid (negative), X-ray (looked fine), blood sample (nothing worth mentioning).

Last week I posted here ranting about how most asthmatics aren't prioritised in group 6. It was particularly frustrating for me because I'm a teacher, my partner is a nurse and I'm only 24 so it's looking like June before I'd get it if only my age was taken into account.

I decided to email my GP to explain my situation, in the hope that they'd be a bit more flexible because of my circumstances. They got back to me saying there's nothing on my records to suggest I'm in group 6, but there might be something my records have missed, so sent me a list of requirements for group 6.

13,"Hi,

I wonder whether someone has a similar Asthma story or ideas about what could be happening.

**The context:**

\- 38y old male, 189cm,  94kg, 14-16% body fat, sedentary job.

\- Allergies (hay fever + dust mites) since childhood, always treated with antihistamines (eye drops and nasal spray) and with that it was ok

\- 5 years ago I started having breathing problems at night, sleep lab resulted in nothing, in the end doctors said it was Asthma (Peak flow confirmed that), treatment with symbicort 3x a day and everything was fine. A note though: I never had an Asthma attack (just waking up at night), no cough (just clearing my throat) and never problems with exercise.

\- 2 years ago I started lifting heavy (3x a week), eating much healthier, Capoeira - no problems as long as I took my medication.

**The problem:**

\- 6 weeks ago around 3 PM I had my first Asthma attack  (feelings of suffocating included) and from then one every few days I woke up at 2-4 AM and couldn't get back to sleep. Things I tried that didn't resolve the issue: open window at night, closed window at night, humidifier, drinking lots of water, removing all dust from the room, sleeping in an otherwise unused room. anti-allergy covers for pillow + mattress, regularly washing sheets, using more pillows, increasing symbicort up to 16 puffs a day.

\- Things that helped were: First and foremost Singulair, since then I have had no further asthma attack but I still wake up some nights and cant get back to sleep because it feels my lungs are filled with something (though much less than without singulair) I don't get enough oxygen and my arms/feet tickle and move by themselves, waking me up.

A strange symptom that I have is: Whenever I wake up at night and it's bad enough that I cant get back to sleep anymore, I always had the feeling of a dry lung (and mouth). No cough although it feels like there is stuff in the lung. During the day all those symptoms disappear.

Two days ago I discovered that raising my legs at night make the lungs ""wet"" again after 15 minutes, and from then on I can get rid of the mucus by clearing my throat.

**My theory:**

Maybe I don't really have Asthma but sort of a ""nightly dry lung syndrome"" (remember humidifier and drinking lots of water don't help) and when the lung is dry it can't get rid of the allergens, exacerbating an otherwise only mild asthma.

Any ideas, or suggestions as to what could be happening. Needless to say, my allergist/lung doctor and heart doctor have no idea what's happening. My lung volume was 120% (of a comparable person) measured 4h after an attack and 150% last year during a routine checkup.",Asthma,Strange Asthma - feeling of a dry lung,1614249195
14,"About 2 years ago I started developing symptoms of asthma but only during exercise. My doctor said it was exercise induced asthma and prescribed me an albutetol rescue inhaler. Over the past 2 years it has progressively worse and worse. I have asthma attacks from things not exercise related. My rescue inhaler helps sometimes, but I'm having to use it more and more often. Is it possible for exercise induced asthma to turn into regular asthma? At what point should I talk to my doctor about a maintenance inhaler? I don't know anyone else with asthma like this and I'm confused and kind of scared. Any help would be appreciated!",Asthma,Asthma getting worse,1614241607
15,"8 years ago, when I was 6, I was admitted into an ER in Aushwill, Switzerland due to an asthma attack. I remember waking up, confused, and disoriented. The first thing I realized though, was that I felt like I was underwater. I couldn't breathe, even if I wanted to. This was my first time having such an experience. I eventually got upstairs to my parents and woke them up when they called an ambulance. It took around 7 MINUTES for the ambulance to arrive. Which is a long time when you can't breathe. The worst part though was that we did not have any emergency drugs that would open up my lungs because I couldn't inhale enough for the inhalers to work. I ended up in the hospital, on a ventilator, for 48 hours, because I was without oxygen for so long. I was in the hospital for so long because the amount of Prednezone, and Albuderol had risen my heart rate to over 186 BPM.

This is my story, I have had plenty of asthma attacks since then, but over my experiences I have learned a couple things.

1. Always stay on top of how many puffs are in your inhaler
2. Not all inhalers can work specifically for you. In this case, not only had I run out of puffs in my    inhaler because I wasn't checking, but I was on Advair which wasn't working well for me.
3. ALWAYS have emergency meds nearby in case you have an asthma attack.

Last week I ended up in urgent care with a diagnosis of asthmatic bronchitis. After consulting with my pulmonologist, I went on 40 mg of prednisone for 6 days and a z-pack. I’m just finishing the last of the pred. Here are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\--I’ve read that sometimes you can flare again right after you finish the pred. Is there anything I should look out for? Right now I feel pretty good. 

\--I’m speaking to my doc again on Tue. Is there anything I should ask for? Right now I’m on Symbicort 2 puffs, twice a day, Flovent 4 puffs, twice a day, and Symbicort as needed.

\--My main question is, is it common to need pred every now and again? Or is this a sign that my current treatment isn’t working?

I posted a week ago about how I had a really severe attack. I’m realizing that my anxiety is likely the biggest trigger for me at this point aside from the cold and I’m falling into my OCD-cycle where all I can focus on is my asthma/lungs and hence making it worse. I am doing better than last week but not as well as I’d have hoped and I’m realizing that although yes, I have asthma and did have an attack, that I have been hyper-focused on my asthma in the months leading to the attack and I think I’m truly making it worse. When I’m busy and focused and stress free I almost always feel fine whereas the second I’m bored and left to think or stressed suddenly my chest feels tight and painful and I can’t get a full breath. Often times my peak flow in these instances is either peak or my norm. My O2 is always fine. The inhaler helps sometimes others doesn’t, but I truly don’t know if that’s a sign it’s actually the asthma or if it’s a placebo. I’m doing this to myself. This has happened before where when my OCD fixated on my asthma I’m horrible for months but the second a new health concern comes along suddenly my asthma is fine or better controlled. I want to stress the fact that I do have asthma as diagnosed by pulmonary function testing and my asthma also has triggers like cardio, allergies, and the cold, but I truly think right now my issue is me. Besides being told to go to therapy (I’m in therapy) or take meds, I guess I’m here to ask if anyone else has this issue and what coping skills you use to distract from anxiety which either causes asthma or anxiety surrounding your asthma.

Escitalopram 20mg/Bupropion 150mg XL/Dextroamphetamine 20mg/Albuterol/Dulera

I'm not looking for medical advice but I'd love to hear from people. I literally have no experience with asthma or allergies so I'm pretty naïve. I've been recently diagnosed as having asthma (last three months) and I have questions for people.

About me: I'm super nervous about medication in general, I have always been weirdly sensitive to everything I take. It seems weird that I've made it all these years without a proper allergy diagnosis and that I never had asthma symptoms until I got a new kitten in September. I have had my first cat for a year now and never noticed anything like this until we got the baby. My anxiety makes me feel like it's probably lung cancer or emphysema from the years that I smoked, but obviously I hope it's just asthma. 

I have just had the allergy blood testing, my doctor said we couldn't do the skin test because she was afraid I'd have an asthma attack? Or perhaps I misunderstood and couldn't do it because I'd used Albuterol that day. I also had a chest x-ray to make sure it's not something else.

I really, really am not liking how the Dulera is making me feel. I took my first two puffs this morning as instructed and since then I feel like there is mucus in my throat and I was coughing a lot. I had to use Albuterol within 20 minutes. I'm still shaky and feeling weird and I really hope that this will pass or I get used to it. Of course my doctors office is closed until Monday, which is really annoying so I can't call and check in. 

1. Does anyone have a cat allergy that has caused/worsened asthma? Did you find a way to keep your cats or did you have to re-home them? 
2. Dulera experiences please. Did it make you feel like shit at first? I'm trying to analyze myself and see if it's my anxiety or if I really am having a bad reaction. I read through the side effects and don't actually have trouble breathing or any sort of swelling so I don't think I'm allergic to it. I hear that weight gain is likely with this, which is the last thing I need. I'm failing out of weight watchers as it is.

91,"Hey everyone! I just wanted to reach out for some ideas on what could be the issue. Before I write, I have a pulmonologist, ENT and an allergy doc.

Okay so back in September 2020 my asthma really started to get out of control. I was on Breo 200/25 for maybe a year before this so my asthma was already a problem. I’ve been on steroid inhalers since I was like 5, I’m 25 now (f) and my asthma has only gotten worse since September. I had multiple asthma attacks in November and that sent me spiraling into this out of control issue where I constantly have to clear my throat because of phlegm build up. I’ve had 3 steroid shots since September 2020, been on 5 rounds of prednisone from the basic Z pack to 50mg. I went to the urgent care/ER center in January and had an x Ray, which came back clear. But given the symptoms of the plegm, persistent upper back pain and shortness of breath the doc diagnosed me with atypical pneumonia and sent me on my way with a 5 day dose of Azithromycin and 50mg prednisone. Nothing really changed, so my pulmonologist told me to try Trelegy and gave me a months worth of samples which I’m still using. (I can’t really tell a difference). I had maybe 3 good days after the course of antibiotics and steroids then the phlegm came back. So I told my primary and she sent me in for a CT of the chest. It came back and in my right lung I have about 5mm of a“Ground glass nodular opacity” (not Covid related). I freaked out because I thought there was a lump in my lung but I guess there isn’t? I don’t KNOW. So I followed up with my new pulmonary doctor 3 weeks after the first round of antibiotics and steroids he gave me a ten day dose of Avelox 400mg and now tomorrow is my last dose. I STILL HAVE THE PHLEGM ISSUE, though it’s not as bad as before. I just always sound like I’m about to make a damn speech OR my aunt who is a lifelong smoker with emphysema. It’s bad. 
I haven’t worked out in months because it’s hard to breathe and my asthma flairs up so easily. I’m now on the lowest dose of Trelegy 100/62.5/25 and off Allegra so my eosinophil count goes up so that I can try and qualify for Fasenra.
Any ideas on what the heck could be the problem? I don’t smoke. I’m relatively healthy, 5’7, 135lbs. I’m writing this late at night so hopefully this post makes sense. I’m drinking golden milk powder with a plant based milk like every day. I’ve been eating healthier and I cut out obvious sugars. I finally got my first dose of the COVID 19 vaccine so I’m grateful for that. 
I don’t know guys. I’m at a loss, and I can’t keep missing work for all of these doctors appointments and Google isn’t any help. I’m not saying I’ll take what y’all say as a diagnosis, but maybe if you have an idea just throw it out there and I’ll ask my doc if it could be a possibility.

96,"I may also post this in the coronavirus asthma sub, but this is also a more general question about asthmatic inflammation.

**Background**: 32 year-old male. Was in pretty good health (ran 35-40 miles weekly). Lifelong allergic asthmatic. Typically get flare-ups once or twice per year that last a few weeks from earliest symptoms to complete recovery. No other significant medical issues to speak of. Despite almost literally working from home and isolating since March, I nonetheless managed to test positive for COVID-19 on December 24. Since the initial fever subsided, my only symptom has been continuous asthmatic inflammation. Relevant medications (some of which I was already taking) include Zyrtec, Montelukast, Nasacort, Symbicort, and my PCP's recommended doses of Vitamin D3, Vitamin C, Vitamin B12, Zinc, and CoQ10. I typically use my albuterol nebulizer twice per day. I was put on a six-day course of prednisone in roughly my second week of the illness, which helped only during those first few days. I keep in touch regularly with my PCP, who has been my physician literally my entire life. I also had a new patient appointment with the referred pulmonologist scheduled for today. But, alas, I live in the Dallas area, which means I leave in a state that is criminally irresponsible with its infrastructure. I can only hope to reschedule at some point in the next couple of weeks, which is a hell of a long time when every day is misery. Also, for whatever it's worth, I have yet to test negative, as of about ten days ago, though I've been told that the PCR test is simply continuing to pick up inactive remnants of the virus.

**Question**: I have *many* questions, of course. But what I would really like to understood is what determines the length of this kind of asthmatic inflammation. I was told by an infectious disease specialist (via telehealth) that my body is simply experiencing inflammation as a prolonged response to my prior viral infection. OK, yes, I get that. However, if there is no active threat (no live virus), and if we also assume that my immune system doesn't have a conscious, begrudging memory of the live virus from some five or six years ago, then what is the *current, direct cause* of this inflammation, such that is continuing for some eight weeks and counting? Again, I understand that it is a reaction to my prior viral infection, but I'm not also experiencing a reaction to a prior viral infection that I had when I was seven years old. So, there has to be some other variable that determines if and when I see some improvement, let alone the faint hope of recovery. Is the presence of various antibodies themselves (IgE, IgM, etc.)? Is it possible that even the inactive viral remnants of the virus are being falsely ""perceived"" as an active threat? What is the *reason - now, today*? 

Apologies for the venting. My questions are sincere, and I would like to understand, if anyone has knowledge to share. I understand that no one can offer medical advice via Reddit. But after two months of one of my most basic biological functions being under attack - plus now this weather/energy crisis we have experienced - it seems that even the most tenuous form of ""answers"" feels like all I can hope for.

I noticed that whenever I shower the steam or heat makes it hard for me to breathe even once I’m out of the bathroom. I looked it up presuming it would be about asthma but found a bunch of COPD stuff instead. I always feel like heat or humidity makes my throat close up more than just being tired. I feel pretty weak and kinda dizzy after showers cause of this. I have an appt with my asthma doctor in a week but I just wanted some outside perspective first. I’m 19 and I’ve never smoked and I’m pretty active. I don’t wanna go to the doctor and ask about COPD and look like an idiot so I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has some advice or knowledge about any of this.

4,"Hello. Im a 23F with asthma. I am mostly allergic to dust and slightly to pollen and pet dander. Im 138 lbs and 5’4”. 

I was diagnosed with asthma March 2020 so I am fairly new to asthma. When I was diagnosed and prescribed meds, I was on Symbicort 80/4.5 mcg (2 puffs every morning and night), montelukast nightly, and albuterol as needed. My asthma was very controlled, rarely had asthma symptoms and rarely used rescue inhaler unless I was about to exercise. I was basically normal.

Then end of October 2020 I got the common cold and that lasted for about 2 weeks. It did make me slightly short of breath and I had a runny nose. I know it was not covid because I got tested twice and it was negative. After the 2 weeks I assummed the shortness of breath would go away because my runny nose was gone but for another 2 weeks I was just coughing alot of green/yellow phlegm and still had the shortness of breath. 

By end of November I decided to go to my doctor and she told me I had acute bronchitis so she prescribed me azithromyocin and medrol dosepak. After taking that along with my regular asthma meds I was back to normal. That only lasted for a month because by the end of December I began to experience random shortness of breath again during the day and waking up short of breath. I was using my rescue inhaler constantly. The coughing up phlegm had completely gone away tho. But I had not been sick before so I don’t know why these symptoms popped up again since I had already recovered from the bronchitis. 

End of January 2021, went back to doctor and she increased my Symbicort to 160/4.5 mcg, told me to start taking Zyrtec daily, continue my montelukast nightly, and take 10mg prednisone tabs for 10 days. I decided to withhold on the prednisone and see if taking a higher dose of Symbicort and taking Zyrtec would improve my symptoms but they have not. I don’t want to take prednisone because I feel like it will only mask my symptoms for a while and the symptoms will come back. 

I dont know what to do? How did I go from having my asthma controlled really well to having acute bronchitis and getting better for 1 month and then to not being able to control my asthma for 2 months? 

Am I missing something? Could I still have bronchitis and not know it? Could something else be worsening my asthma that the doctor hasn’t discovered yet? Will taking prednisone really improve my asthma symptoms or just improve them temporarily? What should I ask the doctor to do? I really don’t want to keep increasing my meds.

I'm starting to think I have I have something more than just asthma. Like an autoimmune problem.

I get more relief from montelukast and oral steroids than I do from symbicort or albuterol.

But montelukast duration of action is only about 3-4 hours. And the max dose is only once a day.

I can't afford anything like those medicines like dupixant, xolair and etc.

Honestly, I just want to cry. I've had asthma since I was a teenager and I know it makes me get bugs worse (like lie in bed for 5 days with a cold that everyone else in the house can get away with just an early night with). I had actual flu a couple of years ago and it was absolutely horrific. I just don't get it, I'm on the flu jab list and Covid is worse than flu. If I'm vulnerable to flu, surely I'm vulnerable to Covid? 

I've been taking the rules incredibly seriously all the way through this, in the hope there would be a vaccine and I'd be high-ish priority to get it, but apparently not. By the looks of it, asthmatics aren't being given any extra prioritisation so I'll be way way down the list because I'm only 24. 

To add to the stress of this, I'm a supply teacher so going into work is putting myself at risk. In January, I decided to pause going into work until I get the vaccine, because at that point I was under the assumption I would get it relatively soon. Now I just don't know what to do. It's one thing forgoing all income for 2-3 months while I wait on the vaccine that should be coming, but I can't do that until god knows when.

The lights around me were really bright and I could see my heartbeat in my eyes. My parents called the ambulance and they also stuck me with an epi pen (originally for my allergies). I didn’t feel it at all, I didn’t even feel it hit my leg. When the ambulance got to the house the Paramedics apparently stuck a huge adrenaline needle in my arm and I barely remember the ride in the ambulance. At the hospital my head just felt numb, like staticky. I was then fed oxygen and then a triple dose of the breathing treatment medicine for like 1/3 hours (I don’t remember the exact).

What happens with your nose when you have an asthma attack? Can you wheeze through your nose the same way you wheeze through your mouth?

Ive also been having some intrusive thoughts and feeling outright depressed/anxious. I’ve been on Singulair for a month now and I really think it has helped with my asthma.

55,"Hi all, hope you're keeping well. I imagine this will concern primarily UK asthmatics who get their inhalers via the NHS. In brief, I find the Salamol CFC-Free inhalers - the little blue reliever ones, I think they are fairly new - hopeless. The chief problem is that they seem to allow the powder to crystalise around the opening of the pump. The result is that when I take a puff, I can feel little particles in my throat, which irritate me and then send me coughing. So the whole thing is pretty counter-productive. I've been asthmatic essentially my whole life (30+ years) and this has never happened before with any other kind of inhaler (e.g. the slightly larger Ventolin inhaler). But it happens with every Salamol one I get.

I have fought forever, feeling that my lungs are actually healthy and my stupid trachea likes to close up with any particulate in the air. My old doctors never listened and kept prescribing different inhalers and steroids.

They would complain that my albuterol usage is way too high, even after reminding them that I exercise a lot. They assumed I lied about taking my steroid inhalers.

Finally I went to a pulmonary clinic that understands allergies and they finally nailed it down to plants and dust mites. They said my lung function did not appear to change enough after using albuterol to “qualify” as an asthmatic. I was dumbfounded.

I never had any problems with my lungs when I was a child. There was one instance in elementary to middle school where I was struck with the flu and for the most part I was able to recover except I was left with persistent coughing. It got to the point that I was crying because I was unable to sleep and I was prescribed the purple disc Advair inhaler. Never got diagnosed. After that I was fine for the rest of my ears up to college. 

Right before entering college, my friend passed their typical cold onto me. I got through the typical cold symptoms fine. But just like my time with the flu, my coughing never went away. It even got to the point that I couldn't talk without coughing and sometimes I would cough so hard I threw up mucus/saliva. I had already moved out of state and started college, so I could not find help without having to pay $$$. The only way for me to be able to be comfortable throughout the day and sleep was to inhale cough drops. Liquid Nyquil and Dayquil also helped with my problem. 

Ever since that miserable start of my college time, I have been having these coughing fits at least twice a year and they would last for months. Sometimes I can feel the triggers (weather, dust, etc.) and then it would feel like my lung/chest are inflamed. There was one time I was in a car for a trip and I felt like I was suffocating while coughing. During college, I was prescribed an inhaler from the school clinic but I was never diagnosed with anything in my lungs. I never got a proper diagnosis either because my parents did not really support me and I was scared of having to pay this huge bill. 

Now that I am a working adult, I would like to seek out a proper diagnosis for my problem. But I'm kind of lost as to what I'm experiencing on whether it's asthma or chronic coughing. My most recent attack was a couple of weeks ago and that lasted from November up until January of nonstop persistent coughing. I was coughing in between words of my sentence. It would be nice to not swallow bags of cough drop anymore. 

TLDR; I'm not sure whether I'm experiencing asthma or chronic coughing. These symptoms started when I began college and persist sometimes today (at least twice a year and it last for months). My symptoms include chest pain, coughing to the point I throw up saliva, shortness of breathe, coughing in between words, sometimes can't breathe while coughing, etc. etc. I never got a proper diagnosis nor did I ever went to the doctor for asthma/chronic coughing because my parents didn't care.

My throat would feel very scratchy and would get a lot of phlegm in my throat. Taking deep breaths afterwards was painful and caused coughing fits. My gym teacher said it could be exercise induced asthma. My doctor said she wasn't comfortable prescribing an inhaler until I saw a specialist. Since I was not regularly exercising, i didn't see it as a huge issue and so I never saw a specialist.

Fast forward to now. I got sick in late March was was heavily thought to be covid (no available tests at the time) and exercise became impossible after that. My doctor prescribed me an inhaler to see if that would help. It did and I have been a lot more active ever since.

I use the inhaler (albuterol) 20 minutes before I exercise and I excerise 4-5 times a week (~45 min. of HIIT or 30 min. of running). I actually hit a huge milestone by being able to run/jog for 3 minutes without stopping. With the inhaler, I am a lot more in control of my breathing.

We are a small team of experienced people, with great investors and advisors backing us up, and are on track to release the first version of the app late Spring 2021.

**And we need your help!**

We’re looking for people who would be willing to spend **half an hour** with us using a prototype of the app. It would greatly help us to have real-world feedback (positive or negative) from the people we're trying to help.

Here’s how it would work:

1. Those interested in participating would fill out a [short application](https://info.dopplerhealth.com/usability-testing-survey-application).
2. We would contact selected participants to schedule the interview (we’re looking for a small but diverse group for the first round with additional rounds likely later on)
3. We’d get on a Zoom meeting and have the participant perform a series of tasks using a design prototype of the Doppler Health app. We’ll also have a few other questions about what’s valuable and what’s not. No right or wrong answers.
4. We’ll share a recording of the meeting with other Doppler Health team members to help inform our design and development.
5. The participant gets the choice of a **$100 Amazon gift card or a $200 donation** to the Asthma and Allergy Federation of America.

Im 23F from the UK, having an issue with my doctors and trying to book my Covid Vaccination.

At 3 years old I was diagnosed with Type 2 Brittle asthma, which is a rare and severe form of asthma. I have battled all my life in and out of hospitals, and until 5 years ago was completely uncontrolled until I started a new medication, and have only had a few minor issues from them. Type 2 is classed as Random severe attacks, meaning it can be controlled by medication for an extended period of time. I am on DuoResp Spiromax, an inhaled steroid medication.

In March I was given a letter telling me I was extremely high risk and to shield, and have been shielding since then and have not left my home in practically a year. I tried to book my Vaccination online and it said I was not eligible, and have called 119, they stated to call my doctors and ask them. I called my doctors and they claimed I have never had Brittle asthma, Just mild reactive asthma. I have been to many Respiratory specialists who have confirmed I have Type 2 Brittle Asthma, as I have my entire life. They are claiming I've never been diagnosed, and therefore will not be receiving a vaccination soon. I told them to check the records, i've always been diagnosed, I've been in ICU with my asthma and they just keep saying I don't have it and wont get a vaccination now.

I have requested my Medical Records to look myself, but know for a fact It is in there that I have this type. I'm not sure where to go from here, as even if I say that it is everywhere in my records, they will try to deny and say it was a misdiagnosis as I'm well controlled for this moment, therefore I can't have it.

85,"My son was diagnosed with asthma at 2.5 years old in the summer of 2019. He was put on a maintenance inhaler and rarely had any issues since, maybe once when he had pneumonia, but albuterol cleared it up right away. 

Back in November he had a cold which lead to the asthmatic coughing. We didn’t realize what kind of cough it was at first, but started him on albuterol anyways but weren’t consistent with it (which I now know wasn’t correct.) We didn’t realize at the time that just because the cough went away for a few days and came back it could still be asthma related. We took him to the pediatrician 2 weeks into this and she gave us an antibiotic in case it was an infection. When he was finishing up the antibiotic, he had a check up appointment with his asthma doctor and she explained to us that just because the cough was going away it was still asthmatic and that she wanted to put him on Singulair. She then told us about the black box warning and it honestly scared the crap out of both me and my husband. We said no because he had been doing so well up till that point. So we said we’d watch it. 

Fast forward to mid January. Gets another cold and he gets the asthmatic cough. This time I know I need to do albuterol every 4-6 hours while awake, so I do and after 2 days he’s 100% better. Well, this week he got another cold and has now had his cough for 4 days. The albuterol seems to help a little but not enough. I know when I call the doctor she’s going to suggest Singulair again and it terrifies me to put him on something that can alter his mental health and cause behavioral issues, as he’s already a very “spirited” child. 

My question (finally) is have any of you had success with a different treatment, or had great success/no side effects with a kid on Singulair?

90,"Hello!

I am 25 years old. For the past couple of years I've really noticed and paid attention to the fact that I breathe faster than other people, am often phlegm-ey, and cannot get a full breath in. If I focus on it then I can say that it feels like I'm trying to breathe through a wet cloth rag constantly. I often feel like I'm oxygen-deprived, which is a weird feeling to describe but that's the feeling I get. I maybe occasionally wheeze if I'm laying down. If this is also wheezing, I notice sometimes when breathing I hear a high pitched ""bird chirping"" sort of sound, but this is pretty rare.

I have brought up difficulty breathing and have had it dismissed as anxiety, but it's a persistent daily problem. I do struggle to breathe more after exercise and in cold air, especially.

When I was a child (maybe 7?) I did have to use an inhaler for a brief period at my grandmother's due to allergies. She has many cats, and I stopped being able to breathe and had to be rushed to the doctor's. For the rest of the visit I believe I took allergy medication and used an inhaler.

No doctor I've been to and brought my breathing problems up to has ever seemed to consider that asthma may be an issue, but I'm wondering if I should bring it up directly the next time I go to the doctor's. Wanted to get some opinions from people who are diagnosed!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

  
edit: As a note, I'm also pretty sure I have really bad GERD. It's not formally diagnosed, but I have all the symptoms and after a year of constant vomiting my doctor has me on pepcid once daily. This has dealt with my stomach issues pretty well, but the breathing issues remain.

No rash or swelling or itching or redness...just numbness.  Last friday I stopped taking the puffer after using it for 4 days.  I made an appt with my dr (for later today).  Yesterday I spoke with my pharmacist,  who said it sounds like an allergic reaction.  She said to ask my dr for the advair brand name puffer.

1)wouldn't the ingredients in the two puffers be similar enough (or the same) that if I'm allergic to one, I will likely be allergic to the other?  

2)if I am still numb from the first puffer, how will I know if I'm having a reaction to the second puffer? (It has been 5 days since I stopped the puffer)

3,"So I was told I had asthma when I was 5.
My asthma has always been triggered by either exercise or by my allergies. 

Anyways, until the age of 14, I had no problem talking in front of people for extended periods of time. I actually quite enjoyed it and was told I spoke well. But around 14-15, I went to live in another country and had to learn English and talk in English 24/7. In class, we would have to talk individually in front of everyone and it made me anxious because I was embarrassed of my accent. As I spoke, I started realizing I really struggled breathing. I’d say a few sentences and then feel like I hadn’t taken a single breath.

I’ve always thought the reason i had this problem was because I spoke too fast. I’m French and French people tend to speak very quickly. So I thought maybe I need to slow it down. Anyways I’m 21 now, I still struggle talking out in public and I’m starting to think it has to do with my asthma. I’m not very shy, and actually I still quite enjoy talking in public (before I run out of breath) so I don’t think it’s necessarily due to stress or anxiety.

I had to record myself talking for an assignment yesterday and I couldn’t speak for more than 2-3min before being out of breath. It was awful and I’m thinking, how am I ever going to be successful one day if I can’t be able to speak. I even struggle talking on the phone with my own mother sometimes.

I want to know if anyone struggles with this or thinks it’s related to asthma?

4,"I was diagnosed with asthma at 7 years old. Since then I have managed it by taking ventolin when I have difficulty breathing. During winter this is around once a month. Over summer it’s close to 1/2 times per year. 

Around 22 I went though a rough patch and spoke to my GP about a preventer. I was told I only needed one if I regularly needed ventolin three times per week. Since then I haven’t asked again and soon after my asthma went back to normal. 

At 28, just after my wedding I had a scary asthma attack. While at hospital I was told to take 10 puff of ventolin at a time if I felt the on set of my asthma. I did that for a while until things went back to normal. I don’t remember anyone recommending I get accessed or anything. While there I was given a peak flow measurer. I didn’t really know what it was but I’ve used it so see if my lung capacity was decreasing. It’s always sat about 280/350. 

Now I’m going through another rough patch. I’ve had two asthmas attacks per day, for two days. I saw a GP for some advice and was left shocked by our conversation. Basically he said I could have mucus in my lungs doing irreversible lung damage. It’s likely I’ll spend the rest of my life breathless. He also said my peak flow should be 520 at a minimum. He’s booked me in for an assessment in two weeks when my asthma is under control.

Now I’m really worried. I’m worried I’ve poorly managed something so important and now I’ve done damage. I’m wondering if that all sounds right to you guys and if there anything else I need to know.

I was around 7 when I was diagnosed and for all of my life I have managed it by using ventolin when I have difficulty breathing. During winter this might be once per month. Over the warmer months I might use it 1/2 per year. 

Around 22 I went through a rough patch and spoke to my GP about a preventive. She advised against it as I wasn’t on ventolin three times per week... which she said was the requirement. 

After that I was basically back to normal so I didn’t really think about it again. 

Around 28, after my wedding (I was pretty fit at the time) I had a massive asthma attack. The whole experience really shook me and I spoke to a few doctors in hospital but no one ever mentioned getting accessed or anything. After I just continued what I’ve always done.

He basically was shocked I didn’t realize mucus sat in your lungs and over time causes lung damage. He said my peak flow is really low and I should be hitting at least 520. He also said I could be breathless for the rest of my life. I’m working on fixing my asthma so I can get properly accessed in a few weeks.

12,"Hey everyone. 

I finished up with an allergist today. I'm a little dejected, and am hoping someone can shed some light on if my symptoms are really due to allergies / asthma - perhaps by someone identifying with my story / symptoms. It's been a 6+ year struggle, with the last 2 being especially brutal. 

I moved to Austin, TX about 7 years ago. 1 year in, I developed symptoms. I felt congested, tired, and found that it was more difficult to run outside when the mold counts were high. 

Over the next 4 years, I was diagnosed with asthma (first exercise induced by my allergist, then allergic by my PCP), and allergies (dust mites, 2 molds), so went on immunotherapy shots. I did this for a year, but didn't see the payoff, so stopped. About 3 years after, my symptoms seemed to be worsening, so I began immunotherapy drops, hoping it would be different. 

After 5 months of drops, I developed a nasty cold, and ever since, I've had shortness of breath,  nasal congestion, and severe fatigue. To boot, I wake up around 4AM, breathless, and have trouble falling back asleep. 

My capacity for exercise has been greatly reduced. I have trouble breathing, and experience chest tightness. This had been happening over the course of the last 5 years, but not to this degree - I used to be able to run 10 miles, and now I can hardly go for 2 at a slow pace. 

Most of the asthma medications, including albuterol, have been relatively ineffective. The only thing that has helped is Singulair and Nasalcrom (to a smaller degree). However, Singuliar made me want to jump off a bridge, so I discontinued. I tried Accolate, too, but found that it didn't work as well, and made me a bit agitated. 

I am in a new area now - Ohio. My wife and I came back to be closer to family during the pandemic. Since arriving, I've found a new allergist. He has tested me for allergies and asthma again - my levels were around 80% on the  Spirometry test (I don't remember the exact measurements), which is inconclusive. So, I had a methacholine challenge done, and that came back negative. 

I am at a bit of a loss. So, given that, and given my symptoms (below), can anyone relate?

1. Nighttime awakenings with an inability to fall back asleep.
2. Shortness of breath - especially upon awaking.
3. Tightness of chest while working out, making it more difficult to breath.
4. General brain fog.
5. Cold hands / feet.
6. Frequent urination.
7. Symptoms seem to vary with weather / changing environments.

I'm not sure if this is by state (I live in MA), but I've had pretty bad asthma my whole life since age 3, and I'm now in my early 30s. I have plenty of medications and have gone through it all, and while I have good days and bad like everyone else, I'm pretty scared of COVID (especially with this state and how high it was). I was actually instructed by my doctor to stay away from any local places as much as possible because of my lungs. The few places I've had to go out too (I lost my job when they had layoffs after the outbreak), I've seen so many people in my particular area of MA who refuse to wear masks unless they are told by a store clerk. It's pretty terrible. 

Anyway my question is: Does anyone know when we might be able to get them or has anyone here gotten it that's under 65-75?

24,"Hello,

I'm wondering if anyone here with chronic asthma has had success in controlling their asthma outside of medication?

I'm curious about the root causes of my asthma and if I can figure out what all my triggers are through examining my diet, physical activity, and environment. If I can find and rule out the triggers that I can control, will my asthma improve significantly?

Asthma: I was born with chronic asthma. It seems to be caused by everything, exercise, cold air, allergies, smoke, laying down, etc. I've been trying to find out the causes of it through examining my diet, exercise, and environment. 

Diet: I've been eating an ""anti-inflammatory diet"" for a month now, but am still having bad asthma. I'm wondering if I should try an all-out elimination diet, like the auto-immune protocol diet (AIP). So far, I feel like I might have a sensitivity to allium (onions, garlic, chives, etc). For example, last night I had shrimp etouffe and got asthma afterwards. The night before I had salmon poke and no asthma. I've been a pretty healthy eater for many years now. Diet details: I have NOT been eating any: red meat like pork or beef, high fat dairy like butter and whole milk, refined or artificial sugar, gluten and refined carbs like white flour, and no saturated fats. I haven't been able to cut out all saturated fat, but I've been pretty good. Does anyone else get asthma after eating certain dishes or foods?

Exercise: My asthma is usually much better when I am intensely physically active on a regular basis. I was playing tennis 3-5 times a week last year, and my asthma was much better overall. I still had to use my inhaler from time to time, but I wasn't experiencing as much asthma as I am now - With COVID restrictions and winter, I haven't been getting as much exercise and my asthma has gotten worse. (I live in the midwest). 

Environment: I don't use candles or stinky cleaners. My partner smokes cigarettes outside. We do cook a lot, but I only experience irritation from cooking when I'm in a busy restaurant usually. I could probably change my sheets and sweep a bit more frequently, but I don't think doing that is about to have a huge impact on my asthma. I also live in a city neighborhood in an apartment above a young family.

I was born in the mid 90s and was diagnosed with asthma in the late 90s and have lived with it since. I wanted to post this to see if anyone has had a similar experience. Growing up, I feel like I was never told how serious asthma actually is. I feel like doctors just assumed I would eventually grow out of it, and didn't tell me enough about it or what to look for as a warning sign that my asthma was not controlled. As a kid, all I knew was that I was supposed to use my rescue inhaler whenever I felt like I couldn't breath. So I did. Sometimes, when I was exposed to an allergen, that was 30 times a day at least. As an adult, I now realize that I have severe asthma that requires other medications beyond albuterol. As a kid I thought, well, I can't breath every 10 minutes, so I should use my rescue inhaler. I have now come to realize how harmful that may have been, and that I should have had better medical support. I really don't blame anyone for this. I think it has to do with the times. But I wanted to post this here to see if any other 90s/20000s kids have had this experience or anything similar.

45,"Hey guys, i’m an 18 year old boy, 5’6, 145 lbs. I played lacrosse and wrestled all through high school. I have had athsma since i’ve been a young boy. What i’m about to describe hasn’t happened recently, but is just something i’ve been thinking about and could never really find what seemed like an accurate description for my symptoms. I can’t think of a time when it didn’t occur when exercising, so i think it is strictly related to that. An example I remember really well and is the most recent, was during a wrestling pre season practice. Keep in mind, it was pre season so I was pretty out of shape. Towards the end of practice we were doing some live wrestling, and I was paired with a really talented kid who was better than me and I didn’t particularly like too much (he was a bit of a jerk). We were wrestling and things started getting really personal for me. He was insulting me all while absolutely recking me. It was towards the end of the period, and was drop dead tired and crazy out of breath.  I got super mad, got a burst of adrenaline and started going ham. about 20 seconds after i felt myself get super tired and nauseous. I started to panic and went to the side of the room. Immediately i could feel my throat closing as if someone was strangling me, or crushing my throat with a pair of pliers. It didn’t feel anything like athsma, and the rescue inhaler did not help whatsoever. I ended up laying on my back, putting a water bottle on my neck, and putting a shirt on my eyes to calm down. It went away in about 30 seconds, and then I was completely fine, just alittle drained. A similar situation was when I was running sprints in lacrosse practice, in 100 degree weather, on a turf. I was crazy tired, pretty pissed off and emotional. Someone shot a ball, it hit me in the thigh really hard, and the same thing happened. I felt like I was going to cry out of nowhere, then the nausea, fatigue, panic, and throat closing happened again. It seems to me like it is somehow tied to overexertion and raging emotions.

I am not sure if anyone can confirm these symptoms as asthma related, but here they are:

* the feeling of not being able to breath in (there are 5% missing)
* in this cases I have to yawn or try to stretch myself and yawn until I get these 5%
* I have a feeling as if something is not right in my chest, maybe something is blocking
* sometimes I get a feeling that something is flapping in my chest
* I sometimes gasp for air for a moment (during the day while doing nothing or talking, sometimes I wake up at night)
* I feel dizzy in these situations (like I would have holding my breath as a child)

&amp;#x200B;

* but the blood oxygen is almost always between 95-100% in these situations

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have:

* no chest pain
* I do not cough
* I do not wake up coughing
* there is almost no mucus involved (a bit is collected near the larynx and I can swallow it down)
* there are no noises while breathing
* I do a lot of sports (cycling, running, working out) without any problems
* I don't have shortness of breath (at least I don't really know what it is)

I do have the above symptoms for years now, with month in-between with no symptoms at all.

ultimately i've done enough trial and error to narrow it down to flonase (2x day, \~12 hrs apart) and albuterol being the only things that help me. when things got really bad a few years back, i went to a pulmonary doctor who tested my allergies. i'm allergic to dust mites (which i knew) and cats.

i'm posting this because it's getting bad again, + there's always been one consistent thing when it's been bad. my chest gets tight in the afternoon / evening. it never wakes me up, but it's gotten to the point where i have to use my inhaler 1-2 times a day now, starting in the afternoon. it's been like this the last month or so. it started as something i needed in the evening, like 7p, but it's starting earlier now, like 3p, or even noon on occasion.

The coughing out of mucus is maximum after eating meals. It's completely white/transparent in colour and foamy. I have to keep clearing my throat almost every minute after meals. I feel this mucus is forming in my throat, not my lungs. 

I talked to doctors regarding this, and they suggested anti histamine medicines, as they think it's due to allergies. I have tried Fexofenadine, montelucast and Levocetirizine tablets for months, but it had on affect on my issue. I even tried Tinofend, an ayurvedic natural anti-histamine medicine, but that too didn't work. I thought my cough might be due to GERD (acid reflux), but I don't experience any burning in my chest after meals, so I don't think that's the cause. I also get the same type of mucus from my throat after pooping. I should also add here that I have been experiencing itching all over the body since past several years, and I have been taking 5mg Levocetirizine daily to keep it under control. The itching is due to an allergic reaction, and not due to some skin issue. 

Foamy white mucus is also associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). But as I said earlier, I have this issue throughout the year, not just when my breathing worsens.

i will just talk about current symptoms. So in november i started to feel some change with my breathing, its not like short breath or something like that more like that i need 1,2 deep breath to get back to normall.  Now when I go up 10 steps I feel like I need a deeper breath one or two to get back to normal, it's not that my soul is falling out and I can't catch my breath I don't have that problem. Because of these symptoms I went to Gp and he listened to my lungs with a stethoscope and he gave me an apratic to measure the oxygen in my blood and everything was fine. Because of my fears about breathing I went to a specialist and he listened to me for a minute and did not hear any suspicious sounds, he also felt my pulse speed up a bit and he also measured my blood oxygen level and that was great. He recommended that I do spirometry, and I didn't finish the test because I blew all the air I had right away with all my strength, which he said was not a problem because usually younger people blow everything they have right away, so he accepted the result. He told me that my lung capacity was excellent (118%) but that there was a possibility of developing bronchitis or asthma. He also thinks that these breathing problems are due to the stomach because I have a lot of gas and I have some stomach discomfort. I don't have any cough, my blood count is great, I normally do activities, I just have a weird feeling like my breathing has changed, it's very hard to explain. My question is whether this device for measuring the level of oxygen in the blood can detect if I have shortness of breath or if the air does not pass enough into the lungs. I forgot to tell you that when I exhale I can hear wheezing, which was strange to me because he didn't hear it under the stethoscope, and I mentioned it as a symptom.  There was another little incident where I pulled a slime out of my throat (it wasn’t out of my lungs) without coughing and where I saw a red dot, although the night before I ate pomegranate so I think it was probably a piece of food because I don’t have any cough and I felt that slime in my throat and pulled it out.

I'll put TLDR here and get to the point: Did you guys who used Alvesco inhaler experience side effects after longer periods of using it? Have you ever gotten a rash as side effect? 

A bit of my back story for more context... 

I've been using Alvesco as controller inhaler and had previously some side effects but my pulmonologist told me to continue using it. Mostly my side effects were connected to not properly washing my mouth after using it (as nobody told me I should do it). 

I had recurring sore throat and mouth dryness, and also some gain weight and trouble sleeping. But never did I have rash.

Yesterday I got a rash and I've been itchy for past week or so. Only logical explanation I found could be a side effect from Alvesco for two reasons. I've been using higher dose for past 2 months and I've had throat infection about ten days ago and had to take antibiotics.

I've researched this online and found out that while using antibiotics you should stop with Alvesco as you can get worse side effects than normally. My general practitioner didn't tell me and I used them all together.

Now that I ended with antibiotics few days ago I got some weird problems. Dry mouth and sore/itchy throat, low grade fever and skin rash. 

Knowing my history with this medicine and how I had many issues before with it I've been wondering if any of you experienced it and did you alternate your dosages or did you change your therapy? 

I am not sure I should continue with something that caused me more problems. At the other hand it could be due to clashing with antibiotics. Anybody else had that experience? 

I am desperate as I need to go for check up and I need to know if I should ask for other controller med...

It was mostly when I was around someone's cat or dog would it get triggered but was easy to fix and would be back to normal the next day.

For whatever reason, in the past 3 weeks or so I have had consistent asthma attacks multiple times per day. I have used \~150 puffs of my inhaler  since the start of the year which is more than I have used in the previous decade. I thought maybe I got pet hair on my clothes or something so I washed everything I could. It happens while at home, while in my office, while in my car, seemingly everywhere.

Does anyone have any ideas to what could be causing it? I thought it would get better in a few days, but it's been 3 weeks and that's much longer than I would have expected.",Asthma,Why has my lifetime of mild asthma become severely worse in the past few weeks?,1611771106

I quit about 2.5 months ago, Almost 2 years ago suddenly out of nowhere i noticed my heart was pounding with exertion and rest and particularly while eating also had Shortness of breath. I went to the doctor and he performed all heart related tests except a lung test/spirometry and wrote it off as anxiety and prescribed me a beta blocker. However, i continued smoking and my symptoms got worse and worse ...increased heart rate,harder or trouble breathing out rather than breathing in,sinus headaches,shallow fast breathing,inability to cough fully/deeply,inability to have relaxed breathing even while bathing/eating, hyperventilating while taking deep breaths, chest tightness, itching in the back while coughing/exercising..I was so scared that I got COPD from smoking, went into cycles of depression and anxiety thinking i have permanent damage....but about 2.5 months ago i said enough and quit smoking ,and i feel a million times better now..I for the first time can feel my belly/diaphragm expanding properly,i can exhale fully,increased lung capacity..got a CT chest done and it shows everything is clear and good...and today i bought a Peak flow meter and the value is around 550..I’m so in shock because about 2.5 months ago Im not sure even if i can get to 1/3rd of that value and couldn’t even exhale fully...I was in a very bad shape back then...also,i know smoking is bad but having such bad symptoms like mine does not seem normal..i think I had asthma ,never got diagnosed and suffered badly...the fast heart rate part scares me..My anxiety for having got some permanent damage from smoking stopped me from going to a doc for 2 years..However, I feel much better and confident now and I’m going to schedule a proper appointment with my pulmonologist soon...Just wanted you guys to give me any insights if this could be a strong case for asthma?

32,"So I've been on Symbicort for a couple of days now. I've noticed some weird side effects, some I've been able to find as common side effects online and some I havent been able to make a connection to the meds at all but it didnt start happening until I started my regular dosage of 2 puffs a day. 
First, heart palpitations, which I've read is the most commen. 
Then, I started getting really nauseous, vomiting at random with no warning. And experiencing really bad acid reflux. 
I've also been really shaky, and I get random waves of chills or overheating. 
My throat always hurts, I cant sleep at night, and I have a constant headache. 
I've noticed splotches in my vision, and my eyes kind of feel bruised.
I also think it may be causing a uti, because I havent done anything different routine wise and I got my first uti in years the day I started it. My UTI's usually resolve themselves after a day or two, but this one seems persistent. 
Now after going down a long list of side effects most people would immediately stop their medication, because to be quite Frank, this is hell. 
But it's the first time in the last month I've been able to breathe without being on oxygen. I'm only 20 and I hate the idea of constantly having to be attached to my machine. I started to feel like I was getting my life back but now I cant sleep, or eat, or function at all. Is the trade off really worth it?

33,"How many of you got told for years and years your symptoms are anxiety? You know what I think is wrong with this? People diagnosing you on the spot without evaluating you. People who are not your therapist.
 I've had evaluations lasting for 4 hours each visit, and the psychiatrists told me they don't think my breathing issuss are anxiety. 

But some random person online can easily say youre just anxious. I've gone through this gaslighting for over 20 years. People who diagnose you like this, randos, doctors, nurses etc are the biggest reason people with asthma and even serious ailments suffer severely without any treatment. You get told enough its anxiety, you start digesting it as the truth. 

What if you told someone their symptoms are anxiety and then they died from covid because they believed you? They thought breathing through it would get rid of their shortness of breath.

People should be more careful with trying to diagnose someone with mental illnesses or even anxiety symptoms when they're not a medical professional, especially in a forum where someone just wants to know if others can relate, so they have the hope to find answers finally.

34,"Haven't been dxed with asthma, and covid tests keep coming back negative. Had wheezing issues for a few years. Tonight was bad. I hung thermal curtains up because cold air causes me issues, and after I hung them up, I started having what I call sips of breath with wheezing. I put on my oximeter and oxygen was normal.

 Nothing was helping me until my boyfriend, (who always seems to be a heater because hes always really warm), put his hands on my chest and within a minute I was able to breathe better. It feels like something is blocked in there even now. Heat is magical to me. Hot steamy showers make my shortness of breath worse sometimes, they're hit or miss.

 Hot soups are great, and heat pads are the number one thing to force me to breathe normal. Any time I get second hand weed or cigarette smoke, but esp weed, it feels like I'm breathing in coldness and my chest hurts, and lungs hurt really bad, too. Anyway, I'm getting a PFT next week.

I have already been to the doctor over this and she just said it was stress, which I don't believe at all. I'm a generally pretty laid back person and don't get stressed easily anyway.

I've had these symptoms on and off since childhood (I'm 35 now) but it was never a big enough problem to seek medical help. But it has become much worse in the past few years. It comes and goes, it will go away for months at times, then come back.

The symptoms are I feel like I can't get a deep enough breath. My airways do not feel constricted, no wheezing or anything, I just can not get that satisfied feeling of a deep breath no matter how hard I try to breathe in. Campfire and woodstove smoke seem to make it worse (which sucks because we heat our house partially with wood), but it also happens sometimes when I'm not near anything like that. It seems to get worse in the winter, but also happens in the summer sometimes. If it gets real bad, I get this burning sensation in the center of my chest like CO2 buildup. It is very aggravating and unpleasant. It will last for hours sometimes. Strangely, I can jog or exercise no problem. The symptoms seem to appear most often when I'm not doing anything at all, just resting. 

My doctor prescribed me an albuterol inhaler that does not seem to help at all, but only at my request as she diagnosed it as stress (which I think is not the case). I want to go back to the doctor but I want some other opinions first so I will have some ""ammunition"" for when I go back.

To be transparent, I smoked cigarettes for 12 years, but quit about 8 years ago. I vaped nicotine after that until about a year and a half ago. Since then I've only vaped cannabis (dry herb and extracts) but none of these ever seemed to be a direct trigger.

My throat gets irritated sometimes and when I clear phlegm from my throat wheezing gets better, but slowly returns again. I have no other issues like shortness of breath and constant cough.

I've always exercised in around 3 or so times a week. I play a fast paced team sport for 2 years now that takes a lot out of me but I do think I'm fitter than I was a year or 2 ago. Gyms and club sports are closed due to covid right now so I'm running with my sister. She has never really exercised before but can outrun me in something as small as a 5k. Same goes for a friend who has started exercising. Just to be clear, I'm not begrudging them at all, I'm just wondering if asthma can stifle someone getting fitter? I feel like I don't improve even though I push myself. I'm sure the cold air doesn't help. 

Also when I return from a run, normally tge air has been very cold. When I get back to the house the air is normally very warm and itvcauses me to kind of cough and struggle a bit catching my breath, even of I was okay on the cold run. Would that be normal?

Next question is on lingering coughs. I always get them, really chesty dry coughs. And they last much longer than anyone else I know prone to coughs. I have a cough now that so dry, it's driving me insane. I've tried cough medicine, I can never seem to produce mucus. Any advice? (I've been tested for covod for this cough, came back negative)

When I have an asthma attack my chest gets really tight and it feels like god has my lungs gripped in his fist and I have to struggle hard to pull air into my lungs but with the pressure I feel on my lungs it takes no effort at all to exhale. It feels like I'm trying to breathe in while someone is pressing a pillow over my face trying to suffocate me. It's like my air passage becomes the size of a coffee straw but opens up on the exhale. I've also read that it's better to breathe through your nose than your mouth but during an asthma attack. Breathing out for me is fine either way but breathing in is much more difficult through my nose than mouth. Why is my asthma different?? Is anyone else's asthma backwards like this or do I just have the worst lungs on the planet?,Asthma,Breathing in vs breathing out,1611308807
76,"At the end of December I was diagnosed with mild asthma - my symptoms are coughing fits.  Breo has helped quite a bit but I didn't realize the side effects that can come with an inhaled steroid.

Im also super swollen/have gained weight.  I noticed a few days ago I have swelling in my legs and I have gained about 5lbs.  There is no reason I should be gaining, every January I do a cut of all the crap from my diet and cut alcohol so I should be losing if anything.

83,"Hello, I am in desperate need of advice. I am a 23M and I allegedly have asthma now. I say this because I moved into a friends, knowing they have 3 cats (I am allergic to cats, it affects my breathing). I got cat shots to make my allergy go away months leading up so it would hopefully not affect me. Telling my allergist this she prescribed me 160/4.5 Symbicort to take before I go to bed. Then I left the house to visit family for a week and did't use the Symbicort because I wasn't around cats. In the middle of the night I woke up and couldn't breathe and went to the hospital just to be safe. I then decided to move out. My allergist then said take 4 puffs a day. I have now been on Symbicort for 4 months and I desperately want to get off of it. My allergist is always trying to get me to get more injections and prescribe me more and more stuff. My allergist and another pulmonologist said I ""have ignited my asthma"" and I will have it forever. How can I have asthma around cats when I haven't been around them since I moved out?

I tried this experiment 10 years ago and had the exact same results. I was able to tolerate the pain for about 2 weeks before I went back on Singulair.

93,"Last year in December and January (so right before the pandemic started getting bad in the states) I started getting wild symptoms of breathlessness and coughing. It started after bronchitis (I often get) so I don't believe it was resulting from covid, I think it's a wild coincidence. 

I went to a new doctor because I hadn't gone in years and of course he was hesitant because of my symptoms. Long story short, I asked to be seen anyway due to the new pandemic and me having to travel into the city for work with the weird issue going on. I just wanted to make sure I was OK. I had these symptoms for 2 months so it didn't align with the covid symptoms we knew about at the time. 

He saw me, sent me for blood work, and I went on my way. Months passed and the symptoms had gotten worse. I was finally seen again and talked about the coughing and breathlessness I had now had for 5 months. Running over a mile or 2 was impossible without breaks (even with albuterol),  I was coughing a lot, and I had to clear mucus like 15 times a day or I'd wheeze. I mentioned to him about how an allergist warned about me developing asthma when I was younger and he jumped on that. Said I had exercise induced asthma and gave me a prescription for albuterol to take 2 puffs before exercise. 

Things just got worse. I had an asthma attack where I couldn't breathe and my roommate and I had to comb for my rescue inhaler. I messaged my doctor about it and he prescribed me wixela inhub 100-50 to take 2x a day. 
The issue is, I was never tested for asthma. I've been on these meds since June and I think they have helped. I had another asthma attack shortly after starting, I still can't run far and need my inhaler to exercise, but otherwise the breathlessness has decreased.

On my part, my doctor doesn't know about my second attack or about the issues I'm still having day to day during exercise (mainly because I'm not sure whether to write them off as mild symptoms that will be there no matter what).

My concern is with my doctor and the fact that I have no basis for my diagnosis. I'm not sure what type of asthma I have, no idea what my lung function is, and feel weird about the fact that I was prescribed a medication over a message.

94,"Hey guys so I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 9 based off of my symptoms, my pulmonary lung function test was fine back then, they didn’t do any further testing (wish they did but back then I didn’t care) 
Now I’m 22 and I am wondering if I’ve had asthma or if it’s something else or just anxiety. 
I got the diagnosis because I would get a tickle cough when outside but I had no allergies. It was weird! But then sports seemed to trigger it but I would get better after I wasn’t running and it would start up right away even after inhaler when I started running again. We now wonder if it is vocal cord dysfunction??

Anyways, I started getting a new symptom after all these years never experiencing it outside of maybe sports but I don’t fully remember it’s been a while since I have gone on a run lol. But it’s random chest tightness and it’s super tight feeling but I never get wheezing ever. My lung function test was so good they said I should be a athlete I wasn’t having symptoms then obviously. I was supposed to do the challenge test but I’m breastfeeding so I can’t..I went through a lot of stress and anxiety as of recent and some health anxiety has come out of it. Then the chest lung tightening started but it isn’t always when I’m feeling anxious but I know that doesn’t necessarily matter. 

I’m seeing my doctor this Thursday to ask if there are any other ways we can know for certain I have asthma. I just don’t want to be taking medicine for something if I don’t have it. 

I don’t know if I just want advice or just want to know other peoples experience with really good lung function tests and no wheezing but they still had asthma. I also had a respiratory allergy blood test done and for all typical allergies all of them were .10 and dust mites just .33 so I’m guessing that doesn’t mean I have allergy induced asthma since those are all negative 🤷🏼‍♀️ obviously talking closely with doctors so no need for the see a doctor comments.

Hope everyone has had as good of a start to the year as they can during these times. Long story short, I'm 23M around 175-178ish cm in height. I had Covid in early December and recovered fairly well (have been having issues these past 2 weeks though 🙄). During my bout of covid I was meticulously tracking Sp02 and PEF. My PEF has been fairly low since it was first assessed and this is what lead to me being told I had asthma. I have no recollection of what it was then, and I rarely ever track because I never feel too bothered by it, but it now sits around a stable 400. 

I know im supposed to be in the higher 500- low 600 region as predicted. My question is, is anybody else out there around my age/ height this low? Is this abnormal even with asthma considered? I'm actually worried that this too low to be considered ok. Any help would be appreciated- cheers!",Asthma,How abnormal is my peak flow for someone with asthma?,1610881963

She also wrote me a prescription for singulair, but I haven't started it yet because I'm too afraid of the side effects (for someone who already has anxiety).

My asthma is variable in that I have been hospitalized for it in youth and every few years need prednisone for it. Recently it's manageable but am wheezy on a daily basis.

Current meds: Symbicort, Ventolin as required. 

The past couple of weeks I've been trying an elimination diet to see what might mitigate symptoms as I don't like what Symbicort does to me otherwise - thrush/candida and weight gain.

Tried eliminating cheese as it seemed obvious but read that cheese doesn't contain as much lactose as other dairy plus I was eating more of other foods to compensate for lack of satiety. 

Randomly started adding chia seeds at every meal (1 tbsp) and I haven't had to use my rescue inhaler since. I know they have omega 3 and negligible amounts of magnesium but I'm basically eating the same as before and it's the only addition.

37,"Brief background: I had surgery in July which was a very hard recovery and led to severe weakness. Wildfires hit in September and in October I was having wheezing, coughing, and attacks where my throat would close on me daily which led to ER visits, epipen use, a course of steroids, etc and a variety of other symptoms. I’ve had 5 negative COVID tests and clear chest X-rays. I tested positive for EBV and had a weakly positive ANA in November which my doctor believes were false positives.

My symptoms are somewhat better now but I’m still experiencing a sore throat, GERD, severe shortness of breath and weakness which leads to attacks if I exert myself by doing everyday things, such as cleaning or laundry so I’ve been bedridden since October. I can’t tolerate oral or inhaled steroids and they don’t seem to help or the side effects aren’t worth the minimal improvements. I had a bone marrow biopsy which showed mildly elevated eosinophils.

PFT results were:
FVC 2.84 94%
FEV1 2.42 96%
FEV1/FVC 85 102%

SVC 2.65 87%
IC 1.52 69%
ERV 1.13 103%
FEV1/SVC 91 109%

TLC 4.95 107%
FRC 3.44 135%
RV 2.31 156%
RV/TLC 47 145%

DLCO 19.91 101%

There was no significant response following administration of bronchodilators (I also didn’t have symptoms that day). 

Conclusion: Normal spirometer. While the TLC is within normal limits the FRC, RV, and RV/TLC ratio are increased. The flow volume loop suggests the possibility of variable intrathoracic obstruction. Air-trapping and hyperinflation are present. Gas exchange is preserved.

====
I was diagnosed at 7 (~1990), after  overnight attacks. After a couple cycles of getting nebulizer meds in  the ER, we found some stuff that worked to manage it - Zaditen, the old  disc/powder-based version of Ventolin, and Pulmicort (turbuhaler). I  eventually didn't need the Pulmicort anymore, and switched to Singulair  after it was approved. 

I have not had an Asthma Attack proper,  since about Junior High. At about 22 or 23 I stopped taking the  Singulair, because it was too expensive, and still not a generic. Since  then, my allergies and Asthma were pretty much under control, save for  poplar season and exertion (like running to catch a bus/train). All I  took was antihistamines during pollen season, and my blue puffer if I  ever started wheezing, typically about once a month.

In the last  few years (yet ANOTHER thing since my shit 2015 where the Fibromyalgia  etc started), things have slowly gotten worse. I started taking Reactine  year round, then in March of 2020, I started taking a DOUBLE dose of  Reactine (20mg) on the advice of a friend (to limit nasal/sinus symptoms  which could potentially be mistaken for COVID), which my doc also gave  his blessing to, but also suggested the next step would be to go back  onto Singulair. I still frequently blow my nose and/or experience perpetual post-nasal drip.

In September 2020, when I went in for refills, my  GP's office got me to see the Primary Care Network's visiting Internal  Medicine specialist instead, for a full meds review. Out of nowhere --  despite the fact that my lungs have /nearly always/ stethoscoped as  ""clear"" (even when I complained of chest tightness), despite my SpO2  always showing 95%+,  and despite only using my blue SABA (salbutamol)  inhaler a max of 1-2x/week during the worst of this summer -- they  prescribed me my first Inhaled Corticosteroid in over 20 years - QVAR  (Beclomethasone) - 1 puff @ sleep/wake, and any time I use my blue SABA.

I  feel like, since September, my lungs have been in a WORSE state than  before. I'm experiencing (or at least noticing?) a more generalized  dyspnea - the ""air hunger"" feeling - usually without any kind of wheezing,  phlegm, or other hallmark ""RED FLAG"" symptoms. Up until today, I'd only taken my SABA 3 times for a total of 5 puffs. (I'm barely wheezing, but the air hunger has been REALLY bad today, with a worsening of my near perpetual post nasal drip.)

I'm also noticing a  marked increase in my need to use decongestants (advil cold + sinus -  pseudophedrine) to get enough air without mouth breathing, if that makes  any sense?

====================

So I guess... questions time?

-  How many of you have experienced a spontaneous exacerbation of your  Asthma/Allergy symptoms since in the last 12-16 months, independent of  whether you've had COVID or not?

- If you're on an ICS, did  things get worse before they got better, assuming it wasn't prescribed  to you as a result of a massive flare?

- Have you needed to supplement with OTC decongestants at all?

-  Have you been diagnosed with anything autoimmune that also affects your  breathing/allergy response? Or something wild like Mast Cell Activation  Disorder?

- Do you have an Asthma Action Plan?  Who (healthcare  provider-wise) did you consult in order to establish one? (ie. your  pharmacist, a respiratory therapist in an ER, your family doctor/GP...?)

-  Does an action plan involve like [How can I word this?] ... Is there  like a tiered structure to it where you self-manage your dosages under  the direction of your doc (and have at least base-level meds available  to you), so that you don't have to go in every time you have a minor  issue, just to be told ""take one more puff each time you take the  others, for the next 2 weeks""? And then once you reach a certain  threshold, THEN you go to your doc because it's an indicator you're on a  wrong med or losing control?",Asthma,"Canadian Asthma Peeps, help?",1610703278

Each new season brings new problems, be it pollen or cold air or whatever and I very rarely feel normal.

It went away for few months but I started feeling breathless few months ago again, although not as bad as before. I have contacted my GP who said she couldn't hear any wheezing in my lungs, there were no signs of infection but she told me to book a lung test if the symptoms persist. They did, so I contacted my surgery and was told lung tests are not being done because of covid.

It feels like someone is sitting on my left rib, then pain goes into my chest and my arm, making it weak, and EKG is normal so not heart. Back in 2018 I had an autonomic test because I have ehlers danlos. I fainted, but also I changed my diet after that and my faintiness got a lot better, but I've always had issues with breathing its just severe now. 

&amp;#x200B;

During the spirometer test, I dont know if you guys have had this, the 3rd time breathing through it (I was lying down, no anxiety, calm) I started wheezing like crazy, the more and more I breathed through the spirometer, I couldnt breathe normally any more. The tech kept telling me to breathe normal...which angered me and I couldnt even tell her ""I Cant breathe! IM TRYING"" Literally the only way I could actually breathe normal is when she put a very hot pad on my chest, and within 30 seconds or so, I could breathe normally. But my autonomic test was ""normal"" so I asked the neurologist about this, why...how can it be when I wheezed so loud and hard? No matter what I did, I couldnt breathe normally. Then he told me I should get an asthma test done. All this crap gets worse in the winter. Esp with my drafty windows, I have to seal them. I cant walk anywhere without coming home and wheezing hard, it takes forever to breathe normal. Right now I can barely keep my eyes open, and I'm not breathing properly, it feels like someone is sitting on my rib. I'm seeing a doctor today but I dont know any more...every doctor I see, or even paramedics say ""Anxiety causes this"" Im not ANXIOUS though. I also have sleep apnea thats untreated. I dont know if any of this ties together...I'm sorry for ranting. I just want to be able to breathe normally :( Ive never had a pulmonary test done, just that one autonomic testing.

In the house they still have the living room and upstairs carpet, but most of the house is hard wood floors. Under the carpet is also hard wood floors, so our plan would be to remove all the carpet first thing, before we move our stuff in.

13,"(Also shared to the Coronavirus Asthma sub.)

Today is Day 17 since symptom onset.

Initial/early symptoms were fever and chills. Transitioned into my usual asthma within a few days.

Fortunately, the fever was gone after about six days. I did not have a cough, no loss of taste/smell, no extreme fatigue, no body aches. If my pulse oximeters are to be trusted, my oxygen has remained in the 97 - 99% range.

Unfortunately, however, I have been on a steady course of using my albuterol nebulizer three times per day - a couple of hours after waking up, again in the later afternoon, and again before bedtime.

I have been taking maximum strength Mucinex in the morning, but I don't feel like it is having any meaningful effect. I've been taking two packets of Emergen-C + Zinc every day, and I've been pushing water constantly.

My asthma is basically upper chest inflammation/tightness. There is no loose/wet cough, even after taking the albuterol. I hope that this is because there is not much liquid or mucus in my lungs, but it's always hard to know.

A few days into the illness, I was prescribed the six-day methylprednisolone dose pack, plus azithromycin. The steroid did help - and, for one day, I even thought I had made a breakthrough and was on the way back to health - but my asthma simply resumed after finishing out the course of the prescriptions.

Historically, the prednisone has been like a miracle drug for my asthma / upper respiratory infections. I would feel so much better within 24-48 hours; I would then develop a very loose cough; and everything would improve from there. Sadly, this has not been the case this time, which is very discouraging.

I know I have it much better than so many other people who have suffered from this virus, but I'm still just feeling very discouraged. I have no idea when I can expect to wean off the albuterol. No idea when I can expect any significant improvement, let alone when I can expect to feel normal again. I've been told by my PCP that there is not much else to be done other than to continue to treat the symptoms and hope for recovery within two to six weeks. I've taken off from work through at least the end of next week...but I can't help but feel like I'm not going to be in any better shape by then.

20,"this isn't a new set of problems but rather a set of problems that has gradually gotten worse over many years, probably been a thing for maybe 12+ years (I'm 30) 

I noticed a few correlations: 1) cold, 2) exercise, 3) dirty environments 

in 2018, I had a lot of chest tightness and this whole breathing through a straw feeling (though a big straw, let's say), a generalized inability to feel like I was getting deep enough breaths, lots of shallow breaths 

that correlated to me living in a cold warehouse that was probably a borderline biohazard

in 2019, I moved in with my parents and was warmer and in a clean environment and had much fewer symptoms, might also help that I wasn't exercising and wasn't in a city 

in later 2019, I moved back to the city and the problems began again in the fall but subsided after a bout of pneumonia and COVID (October and Feb-March, respectively) 

this summer I lived in a very dusty environment at a time when California's air quality was abysmal, with a woman who insisted on leaving the door cracked even though literal smoke was coming in, and my lungs basically shut down

now, winter, I live in a very dirty place that is also very cold and I've been exercising more than ever 

I get a lot of chest tightness whether I'm exercising or not but it's definitely worse when I've been exercising, and it also lasts longer (in the realm of 2 days)

since I'm exercising almost constantly I have a whole lot of the chest tightness feeling and the shallow breathing; I really feel like I'm stressing out the parts that lead into my lungs because it gets pretty sore down there for a couple days after I push myself a bit exercising

since this isn't a new problem I don't imagine I will die from it any time soon, though I suppose past is not predictive of future necessarily, but it is incredibly shitty and taking a real toll on my mental health; I really love exercise and I really love the place I live (for all its faults) but the chest tightness and the shallow breathing and the pain from pushing myself more than usual is just depressing and anxiety inducing, even if it has been a thing for a decade 

also worth noting I feel like my lungs were a lot more open and I took much easier breaths when I smoked weed (18-25), I know weed is a bronchodilator, which might seem to confirm asthmatic constriction? 

I also feel the need to point out I have terrible allergies, I was sneezing 20+ times a day every day for about 5 years and had a constantly blocked nostril before I got flonase, now that isn't a problem anymore 

when I started taking loratadine as a ""just in case"" I noticed that my lungs felt about 50% better, I know asthma and allergies often go hand in hand

A few days ago I started feeling tightness in my chest (a portion of my left arm as well). I can speak but no more than a sentence at a time. My upper body was sore here and there but it was noticeable. I'm a former athlete and I can tell my breaths are a lot shorter than what it should be. I don't have a cough and neither am I weezing. Also one of my nostrils usually become congested if I'm not sitting up. It's weird because it alternates whenever I lay down.

I stopped smoking yesterday and I feel much better today (it maybe due to the inhaler but I'm I don't know for sure.).

I take advair hfa 115/forgot the #. I only take 2 puffs a day versus the maximum of 4 because I always felt fine with 2. I always carry my inhaler around for emergencies/triggers which is less than 5 times a week. 

For the last month I’ve been in a flare up?!

For about 2 days I didn’t realize my advair was out of puffs. I was having shortness of breath. I quickly realized and got a refill. Ever since then, I’ve been having a feeling of chest tightness and sporadic cough. I also had a swollen lymphnode on my neck appear a week later which freaked me out. 

I went to the doctor and was prescribed high dose of prednisone for 5 days, 10 days of antibiotics. That was over 2 weeks ago and I’m still feeling pretty bad. For those wondering about the lymphnode, an ultrasound was done and it looks benign. I still have it. 

I’m using my advair 4x a day instead of my usual 2, doing 2-4 nebulizer treatments a day (which I never needed) and also my inhaler at work. I wear a mask all day while makes me cough even more. By the end of the work day, I have to hurry home for a neb treatment.

I did mention I was already taking them, but they weren't helping. He said I should keep trying. I'm pissed, mainly because I was excited to go to an allergist so they could explain my allergies a little bit further, and he didn't.

But anyway, since doctors seem to be incompetent where I live, I want to ask you what I can do to be able to peacefully live with my cat.

I'm confused because I was able to live in a house with 2 dogs and 4 cats for a year, last year. This is just one cat and we have more space for her to roam, and the rooms have better ventilation.

I'm a little bit overweight and dropped entirely any kind of physical activity, IDK if this is an important factor.

I appreciate any feedback on this. I absolutely can not get rid of this cat. I love her, I've had her for 10 years and I'm responsible for her well being, nobody else can take care of her, and I'm sure something can be done since I just started being this allergic to her.

I’m not jumping to any conclusions and I think it’s important to remember that asthma is a very umbrella term used to refer to a broad set of pathophysiology.   However I wanted to share my experience in case anybody else is in a similar situation.

I was on a very low dose of advair at the beginning of 2020, mostly preventative for exercise.   I had bad asthma as a kid but it was manageable as an adult.   Then at the beginning of the pandemic I started to notice I was short of breath at rest.  I’d just be sitting there watching a movie and I’d feel this sensation of air hunger.   NOTHING else seemed wrong though... my spO2 was 96-98, my peak flow was high, I wasn’t wheezing and salbutamol seemed to only help slightly.    Deep breathing increased my 02 but had no effect on the shortness of breath
This happened on and off for the last 9 months.

I tried everything I could think of for months, experimenting with different combination inhalers and doses before finally giving up and getting a full work up.   Tests seemed pretty normal, with the pulmonary test saying I had moderate asthma and pre-hypertension in the 130s.   So the doctor just upped my dose of advair... and the symptoms seemed to subside again but I felt so unsatisfied.  This didn’t seem like any asthma I had ever had.  It wasn’t that I was struggling to get air in and out, in fact my breathing seemed great, but my lungs felt raw, kinda dry and irritated.  

Well the feeling came back again, even at the highest dose I had taken yet. Then I stumbled on the buteyko breathing.   The idea being that chronically low CO2 from subtle and sub-perceptual hyperventilation was actually causing respiratory alkalosis and reducing tissue oxygenation.  Proponents claim that this chronic state can lead to construction and inflammation in the airways, amongst other things, and result in a chemosensitivity to CO2 that further reinforces this hyperventilation.  It made a lot of sense, I have an extensive medical background.   Well I practised becoming more comfortable with breathing less and I’ve never felt better.   

I will update this post but I felt like I needed to get it out there in case anybody is in the same position.  Would love to hear if anybody else has had a similar experience.  

TLDR:  shortness of breath at rest without any other significant symptoms, diagnosed by specialist as just worsening asthma.   No amount of medication seemed to help.

In the morning, I usually cough pretty badly. Some days, the cough is intense enough to bring me to my knees. Usually, my throat ends up feeling closed and I start to gag. Usually, this makes me vomit. It's never solid food though, only liquid. 

For a long time, I thought it was a GI issue as I have a family history of them, but my doctor thinks that this is being caused by asthma. It makes sense, considering I have a family history of it, too. But, I'd like some more definitive testing.

For example, I easily get asthma if breathing in air that is way colder than my body temperature and I can sort of work around it by unzipping my jacket so Im not as warm, also,  thanks covid, I've noticed that wearing a mask also helps with this, as air travels slower through the mask and gets warmer before going in.
Meanwhile, I never get asthma due to strong odours or allergens around me, and rarely due to physical activity. Actually, I think I get asthma because of getting hot while doing physical activity, not because of actually doing it as taking a layer of clothing usually helps quite a bit.

Sometimes I start coughing because I’m so short of breath. It can get a bit phlegmy by morning.


The feeling starts at about 9pm every night almost like clockwork. It doesn’t seem connected to whether I eat or not at that time. What is this?

77,"Hello! I don’t normally post but have been following this page for awhile. 
My doctor when I was younger gave me a trick to use when I’m desperate for some relief.
A little backstory: I’ve had serve asthma my entire life.  From when I was born until I was about 7, I was hospitalized over and over and over again because I kept getting pneumonia. It got to the point where the doctors told my family that if I didn’t figure something out to control the asthma then next time I get pneumonia I was going on the transplant list because my lungs were too scarred to function properly. 
So they found my pulmonologist who is a lifesaver. His first time for us was when I was sick and coughing and was really struggling to breathe, sit in a closed off bathroom with the water running as hot as it would go. The steam would fill the bathroom and I could finally breathe. It also helped loosen the stuff in my lungs so I was able to cough it out.

Flash forward to now, I’m still seeing the same doctor and I am now 21 and I still swear by this trick and use it all the time. But now I’ve added this Vapor bath soap and it’s amazing. I just put some in the tub once the water is hot and it fills the air with the vapor stuff and helps me be able to breathe enough to go to sleep when I’m sick.

TLDR: Close yourself in the bathroom with shower running as hot as possible and let it steam up. Add what’s in the pic to make it better

20,"I'm a 21 year old, female. i don't have a history of any health problems. a few weeks ago, I got a heater for my bedroom. i usually keep it on at night, but the thing is, for some reason, it makes me have extreme coughing fits in my sleep and it makes my chest feel extremely tight. my cough is so bad that i wake up from my sleep coughing, and I can't go back to sleep because I can't stop. my chest tightness is also very uncomfortable, and makes me wheeze a little bit. the chest tightness makes me have a really hard time breathing.

the thing is though, I've kind of always sometimes had episodes where my chest feels very tight and it feels hard to breathe, but I always thought it was my anxiety. this is why im not sure if im just anxious, or if I have asthma. lately, these episodes have been triggered by my heater, and have gotten quite bad. i dont know if it's normal for everyone to have some trouble breathing with a heater though.

my dad suffers from asthma, so I was thinking that I may have it as well, but I'm not sure.

sometimes the episodes get so bad to the point where my chest is so tight that I can't get any air in at all or even speak. it's really uncomfortable and the only position that helps, is sitting hunched over. if anyone has any suggestions, or if anyone thinks this sounds like asthma or just normal anxiety, please let me know!",Asthma,"Is this asthma, or just anxiety?",1609298587

33,"So I've had asthma exacerbation on and off pretty consistently for about a year. I was given an albuterol inhaler at first, which then escalated to a dose of steroids, and finally a Qvar maintenance inhaler. I won't do systemic steroids. Not unless I absolutely have to. But I thought I'd give Qvar a try as its such a low dose. I started at 40mcg 2x a day spaced 12 hours apart. By day two my lungs cleared up and I was freaked out by how clearly I could breathe. I was on cloud nine. Day 4 and five I started noticing that I would get these bouts of extreme anxiousness and agitation. It would kick in about 15 to thirty minutes after taking my inhaler. It got so bad that I felt I was on crack or some severe stimulant. I would literally shake and tremble and couldn't focus or sit still. I stopped taking it day six and am 4 days off. Breathing issues are coming back slowly. But I'm not having the anxious fits. I guess my question is: does Qvar side effects lessen over time? Was I smart to stop?

34,"(I also posted this in r/truthofmychest but posting it here seems more relevant)

For some context, I'm a 19 year old female from Britain. I have numerous medical conditions, such as severe asthma, EILO (my larynx doesn't open or close at the right times), bronchotrachealmalacia (my windpipe is floppy and, much like my EILO, won't close and open at right times), and finally no thyroid. 

I've had asthma since I was 11 but its gotten worse in the past few years as I've gotten older and is now considered severe. I've been hospitalised on numerous occasions, most recently in November which was the hardest yet due to COVID-19. 
Every time I feel my asthma playing up, I get increasingly frustrated with myself and depression sets in pretty hard after a really bad episode. I often cry and wish that I didn't have the conditions that I do have. 

My EILO and BTM was diagnosed last year, a week before my 18th birthday. I had gone in for a bronchoscopy (a procedure where a doctor will put a camera down your throat and see how your throat reacts to different irritants) and they told me that I had 2 conditions I never even knew existed. EILO is extremely similar to asthma, however the main difference is that while asthma can take a while to cause an issue, EILO can be triggered and cause a reaction almost immediately. This explained multiple times where I had just been sat down and started feeling breathless out of nowhere. Now, that, combined with the BTM, caused another problem. Mucus. Due to all three of my issues, I have mucus trapped in my lungs which makes me more perceptible to viruses and bacterial infections. 

I feel like I'm rambling. There's just so much to cover. 

Whenever I experience symptoms of any of these, it causes me to feel extremely depressed. Sometimes I think of myself as a burden on my friends, family and partner, who all have to deal with the repercussions of my episodes. I try to have a bright outlook on life and I try my best to be as healthy as I can by taking all my medications when I need to, doing breathing exercises to help calm myself and keeping vigilant of irritants and allergens that can set me off. However, no matter what I do, I can still get sick at the drop of a hat. It just feels hopeless sometimes and with COVID-19, its only worsened during the course of the year. I've been so scared of catching the virus because I know that with my conditions, I'd be likely to end up extremely ill or worse. 

I don't normally use reddit but its been exceedingly difficult to keep all these thoughts to myself. I don't wanna talk to my family or friends about it because I know they can't possibly understand how I've been feeling. I'm the only one of my siblings that has any medical conditions, the rest are healthy and have never even been to hospital before. I feel utterly alone and isolated by my own medical problems and I'm not gonna lie, my mental health has really been deteriorating because of it. 

I hope that this post can highlight the struggles that people with invisible conditions can deal with and the mental anguish they can cause. If anyone that sees this can offer any sort of advice on how I can change my way of thinking or offer a positive outlook then I'd love to hear it. 

Thank you so much for reading through this if you have.

39,"Or a generic knockoff since Flonase is expensive as fuck.  

I can't recall how many times being in someone's house when they have animals has sent me into an attack.  The first time I met my now in-laws I ended up going into the emergency room because of prolonged exposure to the dander in their home.  After that ER visit, I saw an allergy and asthma specialist for the first time.  He recommended Flonase. 

I used it for a while and quit when I eventually ran out.  A few years went by, I'd have to take my albuterol regularly when in someone's house with dogs or cats.  Just life with asthma, normal shit. 

A few months ago my wife and I adopted two kittens.  She's a cat lady, and what's a cat lady without cats?  Just a lady.  So we got these two adorable kittens, and my asthma went berserk.  I was quadrupling my QVAR just to survive, taking albuterol 10+ times per day, constantly wiping out my beard and mustache for dander, showering twice a day to get dander off me.  It was miserable.  We keep the cats out of the bedrooms, but there was still little relief.  My wife was worried we'd have to get rid of the cats. 

Anyways, long story short, I remembered the Flonase thing.  I bought some, and it was an overnight difference.  The cats no longer trigger my asthma.  We still don't let them in the bedroom, bit they can sit on my lap, rub against my face, and just be cute kittens, and none of it sets off my asthma.

So yeah, of you have environmental triggers like dander, consider Flonase or a knockoff.

In my 30s I was diagnosed with ""Reactive Airways Disease,"" which used to not be considered asthma but now is.  It was most frequently triggered after recovery from respiratory viral infection and brought under control with Flonase and Flovent (fluticasone).  

Over the decades it got worse and tipped over into asthma so bad I could barely go up a flight of stairs without gasping at the top.  It was particularly bad on hot, humid days so I mostly became a summer shut-in.  At this point Flonase and Flovent were effectively useless.  I needed other solutions.  

My GP referred me to an allergist/immunologist and we started on Biologic drugs while also using high-dose 10 days rounds of prednisone to deal with exacerbations.  First up:  Xolair (and IgE blocker).  It was effectively useless.   Next up:  Nucala.  Less useless, but I was still needing lots of prednisone.  Let's try Fasenra!  Yay, Fasenra worked, but in the meantime I also developed chronic nasal and sinus inflammation -- that got so bad my septum burned thru -- and atopic dermatitis.  

Out of frustration I paid out of pocket to have my genome sequenced.  Lo and behold, I have a mutation in my IL13 gene, which encoded IL-13, which regulates \*all\* of my problems.  Shortly after learning this Dupixent was approved for asthma, nasal polyps, and atopic dermatitis here in Canada, where I love.

I'm at a bit of a standstill with my medical team but have yet to try montelukast, find an ics/laba that works, or do long run of prednisone.. more details below, but if you have any advice, it means the world. I'm so disabled by it atm, 30/m/ no previous health issues.

**Current treatment:** I've been on highest dose steroid inhalers (asmanex), colchicine, Prilosec, Pepcid, Zyrtec, and the NAD+ stack (Vit c, d, zinc, quercetin, 50mg niacin), omega 3 and NAC. 

**Medical record thus far:** My latest PFT (november) was normal, but prior in March showed residual inflation  / normal ct / echo ( but prior abnormal in June) / normal ent / normal mri / normal cpet / sats are almost always normal. Eosinophilic levels seem to be normal. I don't remember getting them tested, but pulmo said bloodwork was normal for that in cbc. Levalbuterol rescue inhaler rarely helps significantly, sometimes a little but so hard to tell. 

**Next steps:** I tried Advair twice (both diskus and HFA), but reacted horribly both times - thinking of asking for a different combo inhaler (like Dulera idk). I haven't tried singular but pulmos are pessimistic it will help. I did one short round prednisone for 5 days after ER visit but that's it. Considering pushing for longer dose, but Pulmos not wanting to since PFT/CT was normal. Also considering pushing for Nebulizer or CPAP - but steep climb with no hard PFT / CT rationale. No known allergies.

I was also diagnosed with Orthostatic Hypotension dysautonomia and doing compression and salt for that, but neuro and cardio noted it can't be causing my SOB.

51,"Hi all, I'm new here but happy to find this forum.

Some quick background - I've had mild/moderate breathing issues for my whole life - when I was a kid and then into my 20s I used to use a rescue inhaler or similar meds for exercise induced asthma. As I've gotten older (I'm 41) the breathing issues seemed to be getting worse, and weren't related to exercise anymore. Specifically, I'd find myself getting short of breath fairly often, particularly at night or if I was out and about running errands. I wasn't wheezing or, like, having attacks, but I'd have long periods where I'd feel like I wasn't catching my breath or taking full breaths. At night I'd get a little wheezy and have the same SOB issues and a lot of nights would put Vicks on my chest just to help myself catch fuller breaths and sleep better.

With all the covid news this year I've obviously been more aware of/paranoid about my breathing, so I went to an allergist about 10 days ago. He confirmed I do seem to have asthma, and he gave me a Breo inhaler to try to see if that would help with daily shortness of breath.

Breo seems to have really helped with that! I'm not short of breath throughout the days anymore, which is SUCH an improvement. But since I started on Breo, I'm suddenly dealing with a mildly productive cough - specifically in the evenings and into the night - that feels like the kind of thing you get when you have a cold and are dealing with postnasal drainage. Specifically, I feel a tickle at the back of my throat and then go into a bit of a coughing fit. It's making me uncomfortable in the evenings and making it really hard to fall asleep unless I prop myself up into a semi-sitting position. (Which I don't like doing.)

I know that coughing is a side effect of Breo, and I also realize that part of what is likely happening is that the mucus that was lodged in my breathing passages before I started on Breo is now loosening up and probably causing some problems. It's only been ten days and I can deal with it for now ... but I wanted to ask if anyone else had ever dealt with something like this and if it's the type of side effect I can expect to get better with time, or what. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!

60,"hey everyone. i'm a survivor of bacteria resistant pneumonia, it's been about a year and half since getting it, and the experience was traumatic to say the least. I have lung damage and pre existing asthma that worsens from pollution and winter changes. I am from china (but now am in america) so pollution has given me long term effects on my lungs. I recently had an asthma attack and dehydration that sent me to the er and hospital for 3 days. I was tested twice for covid and deemed negative. I was, however, put into a covid ward that was nearly at capacity. 

I was released recently with scrips for singulair, abuterol and presnidone. I am wary of taking the latter drug as I know it's an immunosuppressant. Considering I was JUST in the covid ward of the hospital, I am self isolating around my family and expecting that I've been exposed. If I did get covid in the hospital, won't taking a 40mg dose of presnidone severely impact my immune system and lessen the chances of my body fighting covid, leading to a worse version of it? The nurses and staff all were very clean and masked during my stay, but not all were vaccinated and they were going room to room at all hours of the day, I just am being realistic about my chances of covid being in the future. I am obviously anxious about this and I know I should contact a doctor but I do not want to be a bother, considering I just spent 3 days in the hospital because of a minor asthma attack. My asthma has been manageable with rest and abuterol and it's the steroids that I'm wary of taking. I'm considering not taking them. Please let me know your thoughts, I know I am probably being stupid. I just want the best for myself and my family, I only ended up in the ER because I did not have inhalers on hand because I left them in China :(",Asthma,Asthmatic here.

Every asthma medication I’ve been on has temporarily increased my heart rate for about 1-2 hrs after I’ve taken it, and my nebulizer literally makes me shake like a chihuahua. Albuterol (inhaler and nebulizer), pulmicort, advair, they’ve all raised my heart rate briefly. However, recently I’ve been switched to Trelegy, and I feel like my heart beats a bit harder and faster for about 2-4 hrs after I take it. My doctor has me take it right before bed, and I don’t feel the faster heart in the morning or for the rest of the day.

Should I be concerned about this though? This medication has allowed me to breathe properly for the first time in my life, but I don’t want to keep taking it if it’s dangerous.

74,"Hello everyone,

I’m obviously not looking for a medical diagnosis but appreciate any thoughts on my experiences.

So in the past I’ve had a high pitched wheeze at the top end of my inhale and exhale - and a general uncomfortable feeling in my chest. This has occurred:

- after a run in cold air
- when in a dusty environment (I’m allergic to dust and taking an anti-histamine stopped it.

Taking blue ventolin inhaler also stopped the symptoms.

However, over the last year the wheeze has pretty much always been there. It doesn’t really stop me doing anything but it makes me nervous not knowing what it is. 

I have so far had:

- spirometer which has shown normal peak flows. Interestingly the spirometer showed that ventolin was not having an affect on my peak flow, even though it relieves symptoms.

- I have had the bronchial challenge test which did not show a significant drop in my peak flow.

- I’ve had a chest x-ray that didn’t show any abnormalities.

- I have had an MRI scan over my lungs which didn’t show any obstructions or inflammation in my airways. 

- I’ve also had a test with a camera in my upper airways whilst sprinting on a treadmill which didn’t show any reaction or restrictions.

- finally I had a test which you inhale and exhale with an oxygen tank as fast as you can for 5 minutes - the consultant said someone with asthma wouldn’t be able to pass the test, which I did.

As you can see I’ve had quite a few test and the consultant doesn’t know what is causing this wheeze. I’m currently doing some breathing training which I don’t think is really helping.

Trying to see what the next course of actions might people. I can still play sport etc without the ventolin but I’m always on edge with the wheeze - even if it’s not really restricting my breathing.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated - maybe anyone else has had a wheeze they hasn’t been able to determine?

75,"I’ve never had asthma or allergies in my life. I’m 30 years old, but it seems I’ve developed it randomly this year, starting at around June. All of a sudden singing (I’m a singer) and speaking became really difficult, and I would have random episodes of 2-3 hours of difficulty breathing. These episodes happened once every month, so I like of wrote them off as potential anxiety.

Then in October it started to get worse. I started feeling difficulty breathing every time after I worked out. At the end of October, I woke up one day with really intense chest pressure, like someone was sitting on my chest. I was prescribed omeprazole by an ER doctor under the suspicion that the chest pressure was due to reflux. I’ve been on omeprazole and an acid watchers diet for two months now, and some of my symptoms have significantly improved - not as much throat clearing, I’m sleeping better, singing and speaking is not **as** difficult, but I’m still getting difficulty breathing a wheezing with certain triggers (cold air, steam/smoke, perfumes).

If this is asthma, my symptoms are pretty mild, but bothersome nonetheless. I did do a PFT but it came back normal. Regardless, I still think I’m dealing with some asthma symptoms. What’s weird is I feel like I felt the asthma before I felt the GERD (I never got heartburn until a few nights in October).

I’m a bit frustrated with my doctors because as soon as a diagnosis is reached the road kind of stops there and moves on to medication. But I’m stuck on why all of this developed all of a sudden?

99,"Hi!

So, I'm in my early 20s and an 'undiagnosed asthmatic', according to the ER doctor. Middle of september I had an ambulance because I was wheezing and struggling to breathe. 111 (UK medical advice line) recommended the ambulance. When I got there, I was given a nebuliser, covid test came back clear and I was sent home with antibiotics for a chest infection. Multiple times people asked if I had my blue inhaler with me; multiple times I told them I have never been asthmatic. 

It never really cleared up. Skip forward to a few days ago, same thing happened. This time the  paramedics 111 rang were a lot more concerned. The doctor in the a&amp;e ran a few more tests and said this would definitely be considered an 'exacerbation of asthma'/asthma attack + another chest infection. This time I was sent home with steroids, a reliever inhaler and antibiotics. He recommended that I have a very low tolerance for any symptoms and go straight back to a&amp;e if I find the inhaler isn't helping.

I really hate making a big deal out of nothing and both times I phoned 111, I was coaxed into it by my concerned partner, so I'm kind of iffy about making an appointment with my GP for an official test/diagnosis. The ER doc didn't explicitly tell me to, and I'm anxious they'll think I'm ridiculous or something. The first ambulance/ER doctor kind of acted very impatient with me like it was my fault 111 sent the ambulance and I was wasting their time, which doesn't help. 

Has anyone had their asthma diagnosed in a similar way? Or should I just see how I feel after the course of antibiotics and steroids before pursuing an offical diagnosis? I find it really hard to look at my own situation logically so please be somewhat gentle if any of this sounds ridiculous. 

Also: I've seen some people say steam really helps with their asthma. I have the opposite experience - I only have a bath in my house and it hurts so much.  My chest feels like it's in a vice and I cough until I'm sick, even a cooler bath with window open/extractor fan on. I'm not gonna lie, I haven't bathed properly for 3 days because I'm scared to. Is there a way to get around this or am I doomed to have sink baths for the foreseeable future?

1,"Hi All. I’m new here so forgive me if this goes into the wrong place. 

To cut a long story short, I had a flare up of asthma earlier this year and was on a blue (salbutamol) and brown (beclametasone) inhaler. This wasn’t working so well so my GP suggested I try Fostair instead. For the first 5 days or so it was working amazing and made me feel so much better, however, all of a sudden I developed this really weird feeling in the back of my throat (kind of near my Adam’s apple) that made it really awkward to swallow. 

I have a pretty hypersensitive gag reflex to begin with but it’s made me feel really sick when I eat. It almost feels like something is getting stuck in my throat every time I eat or swallow a pill but nothing’s actually getting caught there. 

I use a spacer and gargle with water every time I take my inhaler so feel like I’m doing everything right. Has anyone else ever experienced side effects like this and have any suggestions?

I don't run for 10 minutes and my lungs are already closed, I used to drink green tea before but I stopped taking it because it caused acne, it lowers my defenses and gave me social anxiety due to its antioxidant EGCG.

This same year I experimented with coffee but as time went by I became addicted and never realized how bad it was for me, yesterday reflecting I realized that it was time to change for black tea, why black tea? I have reached this decision since it does not have EGCG when oxidized in the fermentation process.

I have also thought about removing peanuts from my diet since it is an allergen and the processed grated cheese that they sell in supermarkets.

I just got diagnosed with asthma after a long period of not being able to breath properly. It got really worse due to the weather (I live in the cold north, Scandinavia) and i agreed to take a test. I was not expecting asthma, and not at all severe asthma. 
When I was a kid I got these sudden attacks of hyperventilation - the doctors told me it was anxiety, so I started some really heavy anxiety meds. But despite that, I had attacks of hyperventilation and now it shows that it has been asthma all the way. And I’m trapped in a chaos of being on some really strong meds that I have to stop taking.

I don’t know, but I really could use a cheer. Hearing from people with asthma who lives with it and has normal lives. I did smoke A LOT due to stress (approx two years of my life, I’m 26), but I quit during this summer and haven’t touched it since. I run a lot but I feel so restricted, I wake up in the middle of the night feeling like choking. And I’m all alone, scared and really sad. 

At least It was shown that the meds give me a lot of more oxygen. It is nice. But I have to accept that this is for life and that I am responsible for this. It is hard to swallow.

I’m a severe asthmatic who has been hospitalized pretty frequently due to colds becoming pneumonia. My last bout was 3 months ago, had to go on the whole prednisone thing which sucked. So anyways, within the past 3-4 days I noticed I had to take my bricanyl and symbicort like... a LOT. I didn’t feel sick,  but I didn’t when I had pneumonia, either. So finally, yesterday I had to take my bricanyl 3 times in the night and my symbicort 6 times during the day and decided that was enough. 

I went to the ER, and was checked in pretty fast for an xray etc. Thankfully, it doesn’t look like pneumonia yet. And I got my covid test back, so it’s not that. However, all the doctors seemed very surprised that I wasn’t taking ventolin. I never have, I don’t think? And I didn’t really know why either. So they prescribed it to me to take, 2 puffs every 4 hours if needed. I headed home.

It’s the next day and well, illness-wise I feel worse. I’ve been taking the ventolin but I don’t feel right. Almost right after I take it, I swear my breathing is worse? I don’t think it’s in my head... I don’t wheeze, but it feels suddenly like I can’t get enough oxygen. I have to take deep breaths but it doesn’t feel right. It’s a really odd feeling. I also got hives up my left arm in the morning after starting ventolin, but I don’t know if it’s relevant. I feel incredibly nauseous now too, when I wasn’t before. I’m jittery as hell, but I think that’s normal. But right now something just doesn’t feel... right. I’m not wheezing and I don’t feel “tight”. I feel like I’m not getting enough. 

Can I take my other inhalers to make this stop? Is that bad? I swear I feel worse. I’m not sure what to do. Is it just me getting used to it? I feel really not great:(

I went to a walk in clinic recently and they told me it was just anxiety. 

So I convinced myself that they were right . 
But at the same time I know the difference. 

But what’s weird about these asthma spells is it’s not like my usual where there’s like a trigger. Usually there’s always a trigger for me— a cat, exercising, etc. this is different. 

I’ll feel fine one moment and then start feeling short of breath and then it turns to a wheeze. But I can’t cough anything up even if I try.  

I have a neb, proair, advair and singular. 
I have no idea why it’s being triggered. I’ve tried breathing exercises and walking around it doesn’t help. my inhaler does even do much— but if i neb the wheeze goes away for at least until the next day. 

it’s so weird because before this i used a neb like one a year maybe twice.

I basically had really strong Asthma since I was a kid. I tested a lot of different medications. When I was a teenager I started using the inhaler. It helped to avoid really strong asthma crises but I was basically a slave to the inhaler till recent, (I am 29 years old now).

I went to a pneumologist (again), and he suggested me a medication called Relvar Ellipta. He said that I should use it every day, and I would not need the inhaler. 

For the first week I had to use both. But later on I kept using only the Relvar. My breath really got better, I was feeling more strong at the gym and for everyday activities. 

I moved from Brazil to Poland recently. I could not find the same medication here, so I went to the doc to ask for something similar. He suggested me to try to stop using Relvar to see how strong my asthma was, because from the test I was a normal guy without asthma. 

I stop using it for almost 1 year now. Never had any problem related to breath so far. It looks like I never had asthma. My life really improved.

Even though she’s a hypoallergenic dog it sucks because she’s still is a dander farm.

I can’t be anywhere in the house that’s carpeted(aka everywhere except the bathroom and kitchen) since it allows the dander to fester and it gives me really bad asthma along with other symptoms. So that means no TV and chill in the living room, no dining room family time, no going into their shared bedroom, no basement time either which is sad since the basement has a treadmill and a rower.

I am 22F and I moved back in with my parents in Los Angeles around August after graduation because of covid. (I know I shouldn't have stayed at school with my roommates until August, but I promise we were safe. We stayed until the lease was done.) I started law school in September, but its virtual. I've had asthma since Kindergarten and I've never been too frustrated with it. It was just an annoyance that I just dealt with. I use Symbicort for maintenance and albutertol when I am really struggling. I am struggling.

Ever since I moved back to LA and the west coast fires, it feels like I can't catch a break. Now the weather is colder than I am used to (cold for LA, probably not for other places). Law school is exhausting, so is my job and I am so stressed out. I haven't really seen any of my friends or my boyfriend since covid because I don't want to put anyones family in danger but it feels like NOTHING is going right anymore.  

I've haven't gone through albuterol this fast since middle school. I broke out into stress hives twice since Covid and I was prescribed prednisone twice since then and I don't want to take it again. My boyfriend noticed me wheezing over FaceTime calls and I didn't even notice myself. I know you are going to tell me to go get it checked out but TBH IM OVER IT. This is the worst time to be dealing with this right now. I have exams. I have to work. I have to somehow manage a social life without seeing people.

How am I supposed to do all of this? I love my parents but I can't live with them forever. How is my generation supposed to be homeowners without working our butts off?

Over the months my breathing would go from being ok to getting worse, to needing an inhaler. Now, apparently I had asthma as a kid but growing up, never needed it unless I got sick with a cold and sometimes it would just help to take the blue inhaler. However, I didn't really use it that often. 

Going to now, my breathing and coughing has spiraled. Ive been taking ibuprofen over the last 5 months. Currently my coughs have gotten so bad it's just a very dry wheezing cough, that has some mucus. My doctor has said it was asthma, however at this point I don't think it can be.

 Taking an inhaler doesn't do anything. I have an air filter, and that helped for maybe 3 hours before going back to coughing and hearing a wheezing sound when I inhale. Coughing doesn't help either as it just makes the same wheezing sound over and over.

95,"Hello, 

My son is nearly 2 years old. He has a handful of allergies, including quite bad pet allergies. He has been chronically congested for months due to these allergies and was just started on a prescription antihistamine (rupall) to help with that. 

About a week and a half ago, maybe almost 2 weeks. He started developing a nighttime cough. We attributed it to allergies at first but it just continued getting worse. At this point, it wakes him from his sleep at least 2 but up to several times a night. 

Concerned about this, we spoke with our pediatrician. She suspected he either has asthma or is experiencing post nasal allergy drip. His cough is very dry and wakes him up, he's also very congested still despite the rupall. 

She prescribed him a ventolin inhaler and instructed us to use 2 puffs prior to bedtime. She said, if he doesn't cough overnight following the ventolin, its asthma, but if the cough continues, its drip. 

Well, the first night he slept through. He had one slight coughing episode around 1am but it was very light and didn't wake him, only me. 

The second night he slept through until about 5am, then woke up with a mild coughing episode. Then he went back to sleep. 

I suspect she is going to diagnose asthma based on this. As we have been told there's no test that can be performed to confirm asthma at this age. 

I'm nervous because she mentioned that if she diagnoses asthma, he will need a steroid inhaler. My concern is if there will be harm from longterm inhaler use if it turns out down the road that he isn't asthmatic. 

The pediatrician said due to the dry night cough, family history of asthma (his dad had SEVERE asthma as a child) and the current pandemic, she'd rather he be treated for possible asthma than go without treatment if he does have asthma.

I recently got diagnosed with mild persistent asthma when I went to see an allergist a few weeks ago. I had gotten an asthma diagnosis prior from a clinic, but I was just given an albuterol inhaler (no breathing tests were done). 

After going to the allergist, he prescribed me Singulair which didn’t work for me due to some bad side effects. Then, he switched my prescription to Flovent, but that one also didn’t work well as it gave me really bad chest pain and lowered my resting heart rate significantly (mine is usually around 55-65 bpm, and it was in the 40s). Since stopping the Flovent, the side effects subsided in a few days. I called my doctor about it on Tuesday and left a message, but they never got back with me. 

Since Tuesday, I’ve had to use my rescue inhaler 5 times... and this happens often to me with my asthma. I will be fine for 3-4 weeks or sometimes even months, and then, I have multiple attacks in a week and sometimes multiple attacks in a day. I am planning on calling my doctor again on Monday, but my main question is what do I do about the flare ups? This year has definitely been the worst year for me in terms of my asthma. I end up feeling really crummy after the flare ups (sore throat, tight/heavy chest, just exhausted), so I was wondering if there was a way to speed up the recovery from that? 

Part of me knows I probably need to be on a preventative inhaler, but I am not sure since I’ll go months without needing it, and then I’ll randomly have these flare ups. I’ve gone through one albuterol inhaler this year (200 doses/100 attacks), and my allergist said that’s not horrible since it’s really only concerning if people go through two full inhalers in a year. Do you think this constitutes needing a preventative or do I just ride out the flares and enjoy the time that I don’t have them? 

TL;DR: I have mild persistent asthma that randomly flares up. How do I recover quickly from the flare ups, and if I can go months without needing my albuterol, would I even benefit from a preventative inhaler?",Asthma,Random Flare Ups and How to Deal with Them?,1607817587

I used an online peak flow calculator to see an expected value for someone my age and gender. Ended up reaching 88% of the predicted value, and after albuterol my number got even better, but not 100% yet.

My question is how reliable are online peak flow estimate calculators?

I didn’t have asthma growing up. As an adult, I developed allergies, in particular to cats, dust, and ragweed.

Over the past year, I develop problems with my sleeping and breathing. I’m waking up wheezing and having difficulty breathing. I’m also having parasomnias, especially sleep hallucinations as I am falling asleep. When I wake up, I have clear hard mucus that has a lot of air bubbles in it for hours. Otherwise, I’m not sick.

I got sick in last March, with covid like symptoms. I tested negative but my symptoms were severe and long. In particular, I had shortness of breath when active that never fully went away. I was prescribed a blue and red inhaler for day and night that made a huge difference.

For the past 3-4 years, every time I get a respiratory infection, I always get a terrible cough with lung symptoms that last a lot longer than your typical cold. Every time I’ve been sick, the walk in doctors have said I might have asthma but prescribed antibiotics and sent me on my way.

After waking up unable to breathe last night, I finally think I might have a nocturnal form of asthma. I got an emergency walk in clinic appointment today and was told to start taking the inhalers again and seek follow up with my family doctor for asthma assessment.

23,"I've had asthma my whole life, but was always able to ignore it, using my rescue inhaler a couple times per year.  I had some issues last summer, then it returned with a vengeance this summer after my boss got a puppy.  It peaked in July when I was waking up in panic every night with constricted lungs, desperately needing my inhaler.  It was terrifying.

I decided to throw in the towel and go to the allergist.  He casually prescribed me a daily steroid inhaler.  I'd stopped drinking alcohol a week earlier, stopped caffeine a few days earlier, so I decided I would go super extreme with diet as one last ditch effort before committing to the medication routine.  I went on a strict 'Paleo' type diet of unprocessed meat, fruits and vegetables only (adding in eggs and raw milk soon afterward).  That night I had one more asthma attack, and then the next night they were gone.  

I still get a little wheezing here and there, but I have used my rescue inhaler maybe 3 times in the past 5 months.  I pet the office dog almost every day, and he makes my allergies act up a little.  I'd say my asthma is 90% better, and my allergies 60-70% better.

It is a miracle to me.  The interesting thing is that it required 100% perfection in my diet/lifestyle to get rid of the asthma attacks.  I was already eating VERY healthy beforehand.

I would get random times where it would feel really hard to breath which doctors said was just a panic attack but i didnt feel panicked as ive had them before so i know how it feels. i've felt lightheaded from this like i was gonna pass out a few times. I feel fatigued and almost like im not getting enough oxygen to my brain because i feel so foggy minded.

The latter i could do for hours without breaking a sweat when i was able to train during all hours before covid hit, now i can barely last 30 minutes before im huffing and puffing. 

Anyway over the last 2 weeks during which time symptoms have gotten worse I've seen the doctor 3 times.
1st visit he said he could hear wheezing in my lungs and prescribed a Salbutamol inhaler for when symptoms flare up and a course of antibiotics for a week thinking it may be bronchitis. 
Fast forward to now and i have been on antibiotics for 2 weeks, each week a different antibiotic, now on the third antibiotic.

A month ago I decided to get a gut food test as I read this could help, it came back that I have a slight intolerance to milk, gluten, pears, eggs among other things and I was advised to cut this out of my diet. I tried everything previously, new asthma meds, different bedding, humidifier, strong allergy tablets, cutting out boos and even fucking salt caves. None of that worked.

I have spent at least 12 hours googling and yahooing and whatever else I could use to search for ANY INFORMATION that states if it’s both forms of Ketoconazole or if it’s just the Tablet or just the Topical cream. 

The reaction mentioned is the Ketoconazole may cause the fluticasone *FUROATE* (1 of the 2 Breo ingredients) to leave the body more slowly causing a possible higher level of the Fluticasone Furoate in the bloodstream.

I also develop a bit of a cough that can either be dry or not... and for the past 3 years it ends up in multiple chest infections and numerous rounds of antibiotics.

The reason why they were better as I got older was because in high school and college I took gym.  But as an adult, I don't do as much regular exercise. And not only that, I drink more beer(which is wheat which causes inflation).  So..

To keep things succinct, I have never had an attack, wheezing, cough, tightness, bad colds, difficulty exercise etc. my entire life. This year, I felt very mildly breathless after catching a cold. I am quite prone to psychogenic illness and am a true hypochondriac. I went to a specialist who ordered every test imaginable... I did a super detailed spirometry test, chest CT, blood test, mannitol challenge and reversibility test, even took blood from my ear. Everything came back normal. The last test I did was a FeNO (fractional exhaled nitric oxide test) which was high - around 90. I was told I have asthma. I went on Relvar inhaler for a few months and brought it down. My FeNO went back up slightly after not using the inhaler.

I have been able to exercise all this while without issues. I simply do not feel like I have asthma, but my specialist is telling me I do because of the high FeNO. The only thing I felt is super mild breathlessness a few months ago (for the first time in my life) which was short lived.

Should one accept they have asthma simply because they have a high FeNO score even if there are 0 symptoms, and all other tests are normal?

26,"Recently, I discovered my family has a history of asthma. It was only after I researched my symptoms that I suspected I had something funny going on.

When walking longer distances or going to class, I lose my breath and feel like my lungs are going to burst. I get exhausted from trying to race up stairs to make it to class. I'm drained and tired 24/7, and sleep doesn't help my energy levels. My resting heart rate is 94 to 116 bpm, which apparently is high. When I sit or stand up after several minutes, my vision goes black around the edges and I struggle to orient myself (this happens nearly every day). When I run, I find myself in agony after several yards and can't keep up with people my age. I don't recover quickly from cardio - my heart pounds really fast and I get dizzy.

For the person I am, I don't think this is normal. I'm 5'9"", lean, and exercise a good amount in the summer and fall months. What frustrates me is that I feel like I can never, ever keep up with my peers when it comes to physical activity. My doctor said it's just plain asthma and a lack of sleep, but I don't think that's the case. For a time, I was in a medication that made me sleep up to 12 hours a day, and it only made me feel worse. When I had an inhaler, it helped somewhat with the pain aspect, but never the fatigue or lack of ability to keep up.

My EKG was reportedly normal, but I still feel as though something is wrong. Do these symptoms all line up with asthma? Or is there something else happening that my doctor isn't seeing?",Asthma,I'm 18 and struggle to get to class because I'm in pain.,1607214574

34,"So I recently got into an argument with someone who claimed that metered dose inhalers (MDI, the ones that release the dose when you press them, unlike dry powder inhalers (DPI) where you release the dose by breathing in) are so bad for the environment because they release methane; there was even a study on that. 

Well, apart from the fact that we asthmatics need inhalers to survive and not all of us can properly activate DPI because it requires a minimum inhaling strength, I looked up how much methane MDIs produce according to that study. It’s [635,000 tons a year](https://time.com/5717676/asthma-inhalers-and-climate/).

The total amount of methane humans produce a year is [360 million](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_emissions), or 0,18% of total human emissions each year. The study claims that while not everyone can switch to DPIs, switching only 10% of patients to DPI would save around 58,000 tons a year - or 0,016% of emissions. 

Don’t get me wrong. We need to save the planet, and it’s good to know that MDIs emit methane, so that we can switch if it’s medically possible. But as we‘ve seen again and again on this sub, you can’t just switch inhalers like that. They can have different effects on our asthma and can cause different side-effects for each one of us, not to mention the very real and vastly different price tags that a lot of asthmatics around the world must pay for them. 

I just wanted to share these numbers in case any of you encounter the study or someone who wants to convince you that your inhaler is the environmental downfall of society. It‘s not, and given that inhalers are  complex life-saving medication, I‘m sure there are other causes of methane that we could have a look at first that may be easier to cut back on.",Asthma,Inhalers &amp; methane production,1607152527

I have recently been diagnosed with ILO, severe asthma and tracheobronchomalacia. I have been waiting a year for a laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy so the specialist consultant can decide what treatment would be best for each issue. 

I finally have an appointment next week however the hospital have said that I need to have a family member collect me after the procedure. The problem is that all my family are refusing to help me. 

Due to the timing of the appointment it's likely that the earliest i'll be able to leave is 8:30-9pm in the evening and my family says this is too late and they don't want to drive half an hour out of their way for this. It would cost £60 to get a taxi to and from the hospital and I've offered to book and pay for this, all they'd need to do is get in the taxi but they won't do it. This is the only appointment the hospital has available as they're dealing with a significant back log due to covid.

I contacted the endoscopy unit today to explain that I don't have a great support network and asked if I would be able to get a taxi home where someone will be waiting for me. The hospital have said that they will just cancel the appointment and refer me back to the respiratory consultant as ""declined appointment"".

I’m physically fit, run long distance, weight train etc so the people around me such as work colleagues who know I have asthma often disregard it as ‘she’s young and fit so she’s fine’ which is great but not so great during COVID times.

My main symptom is a constant cough, although sometimes I go days without coughing then suddenly it’s back.
I’ve changed medication many times over the years and this has just become the norm.


Since I went back to work in September I found myself suppressing this cough to the point where I’m always conscious about it.

Then a couple of weeks ago after a run I found my chest tight and my breathing was different.
I spoke to the asthma nurse and ended up telling her about suppressing this cough.
She was concerned more about my well-being of suppressing something I can’t help and wanted to know why. I told her that my work colleagues would complain and that it being a symptom of coronavirus I didn’t want to worry people. She told me to start trying to cough and readjusted my medication.

So I’m back to my usual coughing self and my work colleagues become unhappy.
I explained everything to them (we are a small team of 9) but a few remained irritated by me.

I spoke to my manager who asked me to speak to my doctor, the doctor said as it was ‘normal’ for me to cough then I wouldn’t need a Covid test.

My work colleagues continued to berate me, even attempting to find a Covid cough sound online to compare with my chesty cough.
I was ashamed and embarrassed.

I asked my manager if I could go home and book a test and she agreed.

I did the test, haven’t had a result but am having to isolate.

Given an inhaler by a primary care doctor and sent on my way. My asthma and allergies have continued to get worse over the years. I am 200 pounds overweight but have been working slowly to get back down to a healthy weight for the past two months. I stay inside a lot -- especially this year due to COVID -- plus we are in a drought -- which is making my allergies absolutely horrid. I rarely use my rescue inhaler since I try to avoid exercise and going outside when it's SUPER cold.

I exercised for the first time in forever tonight as part of my weight loss regimen. I knew it would probably be a bad idea but my doctor wants me to start doing light exercise to also help my insulin resistance. It was just a quick, 4-minute dance video, nothing too crazy. I was huffing and puffing 3/4 way through it. Did not have a full asthma attack but my chest is full of phlegm now, so I can't sleep and am annoyed. I also know being overweight greatly hinders my asthma and ability to exercise. I am holding out hope that anyone here with asthma saw an improvement with weight loss?

I have gotten a chest ct, and other pulmonary tests and they said my lungs look fine. (I used to be a pack a day smoker for 7 years, but quit over 2 years ago).

27M here, been to the ER three times this year, another three times for the walk in clinic. I have been having what I would describe as shortness of breath (sometimes severe) and chest tightness episodes since April.   


  
Each and every time when they go to listen to me breathe with a stethoscope the doctor will remark on how good my lungs sound (never smoked in my life, was what I consider to be in shape prior to this year.) Blood oxygen levels are always 99-100%. Keep in mind this is in the middle of me feeling like I'm working at like 25% lung capacity. When you guys are in the midst of an asthma attack, do your lungs sound in rough shape or even anything out of the ordinary when the doctor listens to them? Does your blood oxygen level drop in the middle of an attack?  


  
This happened again today which is why I'm posting this. I was at work and by 10am though I was about to collapse. Felt like someone was sitting on my chest and I was taking breaths at like 25% capacity. Thought I was going to call an ambulance but ended up driving to the ER. All for the usual 5 day course of prednisone and another albuterol inhaler. The prednisone may or may not work. I'm on my third brand of albuterol (ventolin, proair, and now a generic.) Albuterol does not seem to make a difference when I'm in the midst of an ""attack.""

I went back to doing what I did when I was in Florida for college, namely running and rowing and, well, now it's much harder. It's not me being out of shape or getting muscle fatigue, instead my asthma just can't keep up and it stops me after only rowing for about 10-20 minutes at my normal pace.

83,"For context I'm an athletic 25 year old female who lives in a dusty little town in rural NSW who has their asthma under control for the first time in their life. 

My regular GP is amazing, and the impact this woman has had on my life is absolutely phenomenal. When I first went to her with my concerns she gave me a referral to get a variety of tests done (a chest x-ray, a spirometry test and a blood test) to ensure that I had been given the correct diagnosis. After evaluating the results she concluded that I was an asthmatic and decided we should try a preventative inhaler.

While I had spent the majority of my childhood in hospital on ventilators, I had never really had a management plan sorted out. With my childhood doctor simply insisting that I should just should take Ventolin several times a day - which severely impacted my ability to sleep, and so I quit it during my teenage years. And so I just suffered through the wheezing, head spins and ""smokers cough.""

My current asthma management plan is taking my preventative inhaler 2x daily 2x puffs morning and night. We were planning to reassess my needs at an unspecified point in the future (due to Covid-19).

Since going on my preventative inhaler my quality of life has improved drastically.  

Rather than being out of breath for hours after workouts and being fatigued for days, I recover within seconds excited for my next session. I feel completely rested after 8 hours of sleep, rather than having ten to twelve hours of disturbed sleep and feeling chronically exhausted throughout the day. I no longer experience constant sinus and chest infections; for the first time in my life I have been able to breathe through my nose. I'm no longer going through bottles and bottles of saline nasal spray. I no longer feel dizzy or breathless when I dart across the room to check something out. And? I no longer have people asking me whether I'm a smoker due to my hacking cough.

I became suicidal because of the limitations asthma had put on my life. I constantly beat myself up because I wasn't able to function efficiently and reach goals I had set out to achieve, and I convinced myself it was just those few extra kilos that were causing all this misery. Now I'm furious with myself for not getting it dealt with sooner or taking it seriously.

Being put on a preventative inhaler was one of the best decisions in my life.

Today I wasn't able to see my regular doctor (the doctors fly in and out from Sydney and she was booked out), but since I just needed to get a prescription for my preventer since everything closes for the holidays and check out a lump on my eye - it's disappearing so I'm not particularly worried, I was just curious as to what is was and wanted a doctor's input.

So, in I went to the doctors office. The first thing I told her about was the lump on my eye. I asked whether cysts can form on the inner eyelid. She immediately asked me how much dairy I have in my diet (of which I have about two servings which includes some cottage cheese at lunch and 100g of yoghurt at breakfast). 

She immediately told me to eliminate dairy from my diet. Most nutritionists I have met don't support eliminating food groups unless one has an adequate reason to do so, and is able to otherwise meet their nutritional needs. Furthermore I don't regularly experience cystic acne (I don't even get acne... like at all), or any digestive upset from the consumption of dairy. I've even done elimination diets in the past to check.

I told her that I am not going to remove dairy from my diet as I've no reason to do so, and I find it a great way to reach my protein requirements as I follow a predominantly plant based diet. She then made nasty comments on how it's not healthy or normal to have a lump your inner eyelid.

It isn't normal, and I may not be a doctor, but I believe it's highly unlikely that it was caused by dairy.

She then hounded me like I was a child incapable of coherent thought and tried to school me about nutrition, telling me that I should be getting regular bloods done and treating me like I wasn't capable of taking care of myself. I eat a wide variety of foods, and follow a meal plan that was recommended to me by a personal trainer. I know I'm on the right track and taking good care of myself these days and I feel great. 

She then started to hound me about my ***ual health and asked me whether I'd had tests and tried to educate me like I was a high-school student. I am an educated adult who donates funds to ***ual health initiatives. She went through all my history, removing a prescription from my file I wanted to keep up for future reference.

I just have a bump on my eye that is healing, and I wanted to know if it could be from when I managed to spill boiling hot coffee in my eye and get my prescription. 

I have a yearly check-up at the start of the year with my regular GP who I know and trust. We check my iron levels, my B12 levels, my ***ual health and assess everything then. I take my health seriously and I do what is necessary to mitigate any potential risks.

This is when I got fed up, jumped in and asked for my preventative prescription.

At this point I didn’t believe the situation could get any worse. 

It did.

This is the point where the advice she gave me could have potentially become life-threatening if I had more severe asthma, had not met with amazing people who are part of the asthmatic management community and hadn’t read the wide variety of Asthma guidelines.

She then continued to barrage me with a myriad of questions and critical statements, amongst them being; “You went so long without treatment and medication, why do you need it now?” and “You should only be taking this medication when you are symptomatic.” without having any knowledge of my personal circumstances or how asthma affects my daily life.

What did she do when I tried to say that I trusted my regular GP with my care, I had a plan to reassess my needs in the future (and will continue to do so lifelong as I implement various lifestyle changes) and I need this medication as I have chronic symptoms that I experience on a daily basis that need to be managed?

She cut me off with a total disregarded for what I said and wanted to say.

At this point, upset with how I wasn’t being taken seriously and was being constantly belittled I stood up and said that “I just want my prescription and I’m walking straight out.”

If I hadn't stood up for myself I wouldn't have gotten my prescription.

Annoyed with this, she berated me like a dog who had broken off a chain “These drugs are steroids. You shouldn’t be taking them if you don’t need them. You should only take them when experiencing a flair up. If you take them every day over time you will experience bone loss, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity…” she continued listing potential risks and leaned in towards me like she was trying to scare me out of taking them, like I wasn’t already aware of the risk and wasn’t taking adequate action to mitigate them. I have a healthy active lifestyle, a healthy diet, I monitor my heart rate and I get my blood pressure and sugar checked every time I go to the doctor.

“It is my duty to only prescribe medication as it is needed.”

I'm an asthmatic, not a drug addict trying to get myself a quick fix.

She then took it upon herself, a doctor that I had only seen once, who had no knowledge of my history (didn't listen when I told her) and did not work with me to the point where I had a management plan that actually allows me to breathe efficiently on a day-to-day basis, to change my treatment plan.

To change my script to only taking 1 puff of my preventative inhaler only when needed (where she wrote “not daily”). Which goes against all other advice that I have been given. 

She is not my regular GP. She has no right to change the treatment plan that I am currently on. Most advice I have been given in my life up unto this point is that preventatives need to be taken daily to be effective.

It terrifies me that this woman is a doctor.  In 2019 there were 421 deaths in Australia due to asthma. I personally know people who have been severely impacted by asthma, and have had life-threatening experiences. Without medication I am not capable of functioning adequately on a day-to-day basis or even leaving the house. I spent the majority of my childhood sickly on ventilators and drips. While I survived that exceptionally long period without an adequate management plan, I wasn’t able to really live. It was a continuous struggle to function and incorporate things I enjoy in my life. If changes need to be made, I want them to be done by the GP that I see regularly and trust. I should have to tell my complete life story, and give all the nitty gritty details to be taken seriously and to get a prescription that had been previously given to me under the advice of my regular GP. This behaviour could result in a death and it infuriates me to have experienced this treatment myself.

This is a small town, where a large portion of people don't have access to internet or support groups for chronic health issues - someone saying things like this could be so unbelievably dangerous.

It’s even more concerning considering to change someone’s medication dosage while there have been asthma weather warnings airing on television.

Since I was so concerned after this experience I did a Karen and wrote a formal complaint of five pages. As a side note there's a lot of nasty comments, and just awful things she said that I've left out that weren't relevant to asthma issue in this post that I'm not comfortable sharing here.

I feel really bad but... it was pretty unpleasant to be treated that way.

TLTR: Doctor who wasn't my saint of a regular GP berated me, treated me like I was an absolute moron and was incapable of taking care of myself and making decisions in my best interest. I have pretty bad social anxiety and struggle with communicating verbally, but I had to practically demand my prescription. She changed my treatment plan on file and told me I shouldn't take my preventative daily.

Basically, I started feeling off about 5 months ago. It was just a sensation of not being able to fully fill my lungs with air, just a tiny bit of lungs left to fill. It did not happen constantly, it could vary even in the same day. I thought it was anxiety and brushed it off. 

Fast forward to a couple of months ago when I started having episodes that lasted from 3-4 days where filling my lungs was harder + chest tightness. I'm guessing these were asthma attacks but it didn't limit my life at all. I could still bike, etc. It was more discomfort than anything else.

I know this sounds like classic asthma, but the thing is... I have never felt at 100% my capacity again. Lets say my baseline is now 90% and when this episodes happen I'm down to 75-80% for a week tops (3-4 days in average).

97,"Briefly- I'm 22, have been dealing with rapidly worsening asthma for over a year now. I was approved for Dupixent, which I'm taking alongside Spiriva, Advair, Singulair, Flonase, and Albuterol as needed. Here's what I've found so far.

1. I had no idea what an ""injection site reaction"" was, because the way it's described is so vague. I ended up having one, which was basically some redness, a little pain, and a few hives right where I had one of the shots (you have to have 2 the first time you get Dupixent). I put hydrocoritzone cream on the site and it went away in about 20 minutes. 
2. You have to get two shots when you start Dupixent. I am on another injectable medication, and I found that Dupixent was much less painful. It comes in either a syringe or an auto-injector. Apparently, insurance (in the US at least) doesn't like to approve the auto-injector, so you'll probably get the syringe. My nurse noted that if the auto-injector is necessary for you (like you're nervous of seeing the needle/ have shaky hands!) you can haggle with your insurance to get it.
3. You have to have Dupixent sent to you by a specialty pharmacy. It comes to you in a cold-packed box. You can't get it at the regular pharmacy where you get your other prescriptions. I was a little annoyed by this, but it is kind of fun to get mail these days.

0,"Ok so I’ve been an asthmatic my whole young age. Things got better at 13, and my life was pretty good until I eventually got out of my parents house at 19.
I’ve had bad asthma come back to me depending on my apartment changes. Colder apartments with mould problems would flare up my breathing problems of course. I have changed apartment 3 times in one year because of my mold sensitivity.
I finally moved to a great apartment where I was the last two years and didn’t use my asthma medication once. It just went away! I was so happy.... I could sleep well and no asthma flares for that whole time.

But I fell in love and moved again this week, this time because I needed an apartment to share just with my boyfriend instead of housemates - and we finally found somewhere we could afford.
It’s been 3 days since we moved in and my breathing is starting to become a problem again. My boyfriend says that my snoring is WORSE like back in my previous apartment (we’ve been together before my last apartment, so the apartment before that I had some serious problems with it - I would come into my bedroom and I could feel the cold weather on my lungs. It doesn’t happen so heavy on this one now tho)
My question is. I just can’t move again now. I have to deal with this. I’m using dehumidifier and oregano oils. What else do you think we can use for the humid weather? Or should I really think about moving house again? Sucks! I have been looking into the sub but didn’t see so many posts about house environment. What are your experiences with this trouble?

2,"Hi everyone... I'm not looking for legitimate medical advice (duh) but I have been to so many doctor appointments in the last few months so I want to see if I should bring up the possibility that I may have asthma to my primary. 

Sometime within the last 6 months I have generally been feeling unwell. More specific symptoms have been chest pain (usually left side around ribs, but can sometimes be felt on right side), shortness of breath, a dry cough and more recently some wheezing. I'm not very in shape but not much has changed over the last 6 months and the shortness of breath happens just walking up the stairs.

I have seen my primary care physician, I've had blood work done several times since August (I'm on Accutane so it's monthly) and due to family history/chest pain, a full cardiac work up. The only thing that has come back is my total cholesterol being a little high, but Accutane can contribute to that. I have a lot of muscle pain in my back as well (again due to Accutane) but the chest pain started before my treatment did. 

I can pretty much differentiate between my normal allergies and the new symptoms. If this doesn't sound like asthma to the people that actually have it, I don't want to make that the reason for a visit and something else get overlooked. Just looking for advice.

I could really use some advice.

After 3 long years of practically no sleep and poor quality of life, my doctor decided to prescribe me asthma meds.

I was using them daily for about 6 months, and then around summer it just stopped. Winter is now back and my nightly ""unable to breath"" sessions sometimes render me unable to sleep completely... Meds ain't helping and I've begun feeling super low on a psychological level.

Odd thing is, I can't breathe through my nose anymore... Even though I've had nasal reconstruction surgery to fix my nasal diaphragm... I've been dealing with doctors, either dismissing my case as placebo, or just kidding around me. One of them even calling in other doctors to behold the first case of ""nose asthma"". Just to clarify... Mouth breather is even harder especially when having an attack.

I don't have a lot of excess weight for it to be a problem, I've been using my meds regularly and most ironically, my spirometer exam showed I have excellent lung capacity (I hat taken a 2 week break from the meds to take it)

I'm a 25M and just went in for a spirometry and xray after having some issues with tightness in throat and shortness of breath.

My PCP doctor said I have very mild asthma. Can a doctor confuse asthma and copd on a spirometry? I asked him after the diagnosis and he said no I definitely dont have copd. Can they really tell just from this test? I dont know my numbers or anything. I went in for allergy testing recently as well and only am allergic to grass.

2 years ago I started having wheezing fits along with difficulty breathing and coughing every time I laughed, as well as once or twice a week when I go to bed. they usually last around 3 or 4 hours.

5 days ago I went to my GP and explained to him basically what I wrote above, he said my symptoms sound like asthma but he was not 100% sure. he prescriped a belcometasone inhaler to use for 2 months two puffs a day and said to come back after that.

75,"Long story...
So when I was in junior high/early high school I had trouble running and my doctor gave me an albuterol inhaler. He said if it helps you have asthma. So every since I was a teenager I assumed I had asthma to some degree. Sometimes when I get a sinus infection I get really bad coughing spells that leave me gasping for air. Again doctors at urgent care just said use inhaler you will be fine and I’ve had a few times where they give me a nebulizer treatment there. I’ve never thought anything of this and any chest pain I assumed was ok and that would go away.

Last month I went to a friends house (masked) so our kids could play. (They are our quarantine buddies) and by the time I got home (5 minutes later) I started having tightness in my chest. It got worse as the day progressed even after using the albuterol inhaler. I had mucus I could feel in my throat that I was trying to cough up and I could feel wheezing in my chest area when I breathed in. Family (in Med profession) suggested Benadryl since we are sure it was some pollen of sorts in the air that triggered it. I went 24hrs with that going on where once Benadryl wore off I felt miserable again. Went to urgent care and doctor told me to use my inhaler and nebulizer. Gave me presidone (sp?) and told me to take it easy. It took a week for me to feel normal and be able to climb the stairs in my house without being winded. 

Today I’m having the same problem. I went to that same friends house yesterday to drop off a craft for our kids virtual play date this weekend and came back miserable. Exact same symptoms and I don’t know what to do to help without going back to urgent care. Our COVID case load went up ridiculously so I don’t want to go back unless absolutely necessary. Also last time I went I ended up having 5 panic attacks in a day just from having to go. (Never had one before-urgent care doctor thought it was inhaler but I don’t think so since that had never happened before).

I am so new to the idea of asthma and understanding what is going on with my body. I used my nebulizer 30 minutes ago after taking a hot shower and making sure to wash my hair again (yesterday I took 2 showers). I have wheezing, mucusy coughing and I feel miserable. 

My state is on pretty strict lockdown so my PCP pretty much said unless things get worse there’s no point going to see a specialist right now because they won’t want to see you because of COVID risks because of the tests you have to do. 

Is there anything I can do at this point to get relief? Is this a normal asthma attack? 

Thanks for reading and any advice you can give me as a noob who didn’t know you had to be properly diagnosed.

76,I am new here. I got told that I have a Asthma caused by allergies from my doctor. I have really struggled with this for about the last 2 to 3 years. I had a cough at first that came and went and now has been with me for at least a year. It’s a dry cough and it’s getting to the point where I can hardly even breathe or catch my breath when I cough. I also get tired doing things that used to be part of my every day life. It’s affecting my every day life and causing more issues for my mental health as well. Not sure if I’m just not understanding asthma enough or even allergies because I’ve never struggled with either until the last few years. But every medication I’ve been on I tried for a while and it didn’t seem to work. Inhalers work a little bit. I just wonder how long do you have to use a medication for it to start working. Because I get so frustrated. I’ve only seen local doctors and I live in a small town area. I have an tela appointment with a Specialist that’s about 4 1/2 hours away from me. However I’m not sure how much the doctor can help me from 4 1/2 hours away. However I didn’t know what other options I really had because I’ve tried three different times to see people here in the area. I think they’ve mostly been trying to treat me for allergies but I think that what I have has gone beyond allergies and that might be the issue.

I just want to share my story and what has worked for me personally in improving my quality of life (emphasizing everyone is different and I have 0 medical background). 

As a little kid, I had mostly exercise-induced asthma. However, this was pretty much eradicated, and I went the majority of my primary/secondary school education telling people I USED to have asthma. There was a notable shift when I went to college, whether a coincidence or not. For a long time I blamed moldy/dusty dorm rooms or seasonal changes, but the issue was always there. Within two years, my life was more or less ruled by my asthma and this became my new normal. I lived on a big campus, so I would need to use my inhaler before I left and when I got to my destination. I would sometimes be struggling to breathe so much I would need to stop for a few minutes to rest. By the time I got to class, my chest was creaking with wheezes like a rusty door on its hinges! When I slept, I would wake up wheezing multiple times throughout the night to use my inhaler. I could barely have a funny conversation without whipping out my inhaler! I ended up using far too many doses than you should a day to get by, and I went through many rounds of Prednisone during these few years when things got really bad. The Prednisone really only made me feel better, but I knew/know it was really harsh on my body! 

Eventually, I found myself hospitalized after a very bad night. After a blood test, they realized that my eosinophil levels were incredibly high, which was likely the cause of my asthma issues. I hadn't been blood tested for many years, so who knows when they started running wild and causing crazy inflammation. I had also been suffering from horrible symptoms like hives all over during physical activity. Until the blood test, all of my struggles were a total mystery. 

Fast forward to today, I am on daily maintenance medicine that has changed my life. I notice a major difference when I take my 2 puffs twice a day than when I take them a little later than usual or I forget. Additionally, I started taking Fasenra every other month to control my eosinophilic asthma. The difference? I can breathe when I exercise, I can breathe when I sleep, I can breathe, period! The hives are gone, and my inhalers lay in a drawer dusty and unused. I haven't been on a round of steroids in over two years.

99,"Life-long (22 years) asthma person. I’ve had bronchitis a few times within the last year. I’m currently going through my worst bout of it (it’s been over a week and a half so far) and my symptoms are not giving up. I’m experiencing strong chest tightness, feeling like I’m breathing through a straw, intense-full body cough, chest and sinus congestion, and achy throat glands. I went to urgent care and they had me convinced I had COVID, until a test came back negative. They gave me a new prescription for my inhaler (my old prescription was expired) and said there wasn’t more they could do (since they thought it was COVID). I’ve been taking OTC robitussin, but it honestly makes me nauseated each time I take it. 

Does anyone have any tips to help me feel better? Ive been off work for over a week and it’s killing me. Thanks!",Asthma,Bronchitis,1606065373
0,"I was diagnosed with asthma as a kid, allergies being the root cause (plenty of outdoor triggers + I’m anaphylactic to all nuts, allergic to other various foods). 

Didn’t have any issues outside of exercising through my teens and early twenties; didn’t even own a rescue inhaler. This year my asthma came back, not sure why. Possibly a combo of the constant wildfire smoke and being home more (I spent four months of Coronatime at home, furloughed). 

I attempted to manage with primatene mist, messed up my airways in the process. I couldn’t eat lesser trigger foods without a reaction, like dairy. A few doc visits later, finally got on Flovent, montekulast, and given a Ventolin rescue inhaler. Everything was under control. 

Unknowingly, my housemate brought home new feed for her bird which contained crushed peanuts. I immediately noticed my regime had stopped working and it culminated to me ending up in the ER a few days later for the first time since I was a small child.

Luckily the reaction stayed in my lungs and I was still able to “move air” as the doc put it (PO levels were low but normal, I guess my lungs were just really inflamed)

I’ve gone from being an active 20-something to getting incredibly winded doing simple things, with immediate chest pain at the slightest triggers. I just got off a 5 day (40mg) course of prednisone today, and I’m scared of a potential rebound. My house has been professionally cleaned, but I’m so flared up and this is uncharted territory for me. The steroids and Benadryl have helped (on top of my regular asthma plan), but I still feel like crap. 

I guess what I’m after is, have any of you had a similar situation trigger a reaction? How long did it take for you to bounce back? Can you get rebound flares after prednisone? 

TLDR: sent to ER from airborne peanut dust exposure. Wanting to know how long my road to recovery is, and if anyone has had their asthma rebound after a course of Prednisone.

2,"Hi everyone, I've had a really confusing time trying to find out what's wrong with me through the medical system. I would appreciate your insights so much, and any advice you have about how to get the most out of my pulmonology visit in a few weeks - it will be my first time seeing a pulmonologist. 

About 14 months ago, at age 27, I started having adult-onset asthma symptoms completely out of nowhere. No history of asthma or anything related to asthma, like allergies, etc. before that. I started having wheezing and shortness of breath at night when going to bed. At first I thought something in my apartment (like mold) that was causing it, but I moved to a new place across the country 3 months ago and the symptoms have only gotten worse. 

I told a doctor about it in January and he prescribed an albuterol inhaler, which helped but didn't always entirely eliminate the symptoms. In April I started taking 44 mcg of Flovent HFA twice per day. At first, this helped a lot -- it eliminated the symptoms entirely for \~2 months. Then it stopped working as well and I continued having the same symptoms while taking Flovent. 

I finally got a spirometry test done last month, and no one has been able to clarify what the results mean. The technician who did the test told me she thinks I'll be diagnosed w/ asthma because my breathing was improved 13% after taking albuterol through a nebulizer, or something like that. Then the physician assistant who ordered the test for me said he doesn't think it's asthma because my ""baseline breathing"" was normal. The test itself says ""Normal baseline pulmonary function testing, with evidence for bronchial hyper responsiveness...These findings could be consistent with asthma in the appropriate clinical circumstances."" 

Meanwhile, my symptoms have worsened -- I previously had symptoms exclusively when lying down at night, but I've started having them during the day sometimes too, especially after eating (I tried taking Prilosec in case this was an acid reflux issue and don't feel like I noticed a difference, but I may need to try again). It was really ruining my life and preventing me from sleeping. So two weeks ago I started a higher Flovent dose -- 88 mcg twice a day. This helped a LOT and made me feel almost normal again. However, last night I had the same symptoms all over again. A lot of shortness of breath overnight, which made it hard to get any sleep. 

I'm finally seeing a pulmonologist in 2.5 weeks and I'm not sure what to expect or what the next steps are. I've never been tested for allergies, but I've had a cat for 5 years and it's possible that I developed a cat allergy. I don't have watery eyes or any other ""typical"" allergy symptoms like that. I've also tried taking Benadryl and Atarax and I don't think they've done anything for the breathing (just make it easier to fall asleep). I've never been a smoker. Also, I get plenty of exercise and so far my symptoms have not flared up at all when exercising. I run long distances and don't experience any symptoms. 

I'm really scared of what's happening to me and worry that I'm gradually losing the ability to breathe. I've read that adult-onset asthma can be a lot harder to understand and control. Maybe I need a higher dose of Flovent. Does anyone know whether asthma maintenance meds can create a dependency? Like by continuing to take them and increase my dose, is it possible my baseline breathing can get worse?

I have been sparingly using my inhaler to save each dose for when I really need it. Some days when I feel like my air ways are tightening I try to hold out and would just use my rescue inhaler because those are a much cheaper option for me. I know this extremely bad but I just can't really afford to spend 300$ a month on an inhaler anymore.

I've been paying 300$ out of pocket each month and am running low on cash so I was just wondering if there were any discount manufacture coupons out there, that anyone can share with me.  or if there was a cheaper solution like ordering from Canada and shipping it over here.

Does anyone have any mask recommendations that will block or filter out the smell of cigarette smoke? The smell of cigarette or vape smoke causes me to cough and my lungs to feel tight and it hurts my throat. Dust makes me feel like this too which is why I’m thinking it’s probably an allergy thing since it makes my eyes hurt a lot if I’m not careful to avoid the dust. 

I ordered something from Etsy and it got here today and apparently someone in that household smokes because even though they didn’t have direct contact with the items, they all still smell like cigarette smoke and I have to let everything air out before I can bring it inside. 

I keep forgetting that this is a problem for me because I haven’t went outside much because of Covid and I haven’t been on my school campus since last year so I don’t frequently encounter smoke.

I used to have exercise induced asthma, but a two month (March-May) Covid visit turned that into a full blown asthma. In August, I tried going for a run once, had to use my inhaler three times and thought the crisis wouldn't end. Obviously, I have not tried running since. Up to September, I only did mild exercising indoor, nothing cardio, as even when I was just walking slowly I could feel the tingling in my throat and my lungs that usually announced a crisis. Recently, I have been able to walk normally again, even added mild cardio exercises to my routine, and thinks have been good, but I miss running.

So I am asking here for advices and tips for other asthmatics on how to avoid crisis when starting to run again. If I feel a crisis coming up, should I stop and walk back home? Or just sit down and then later go back home when the crisis is averted? Are there type of warm up I can do to prepare my lungs for this? It is a big step for me, as I am still a bit scared of getting another crisis. Is there a running program you would recommend for asthmatics? 

I know I should ask my doctor, but last time I asked about my asthma (before that infamous run), he only told me that since I got the inhaler I'd be fine (I also know I need a new doctor, but that's for later).

In August of this year i started noticing pain in my chest. It started in the middle of my chest as a slight ""sharp stinging"" feeling. This progressed and eventually i got a cough where i coughed up black stuff followed with eventually shortness of breath. I got a COVID test, and it came back negative. I ended up going to the hospital a week after this started (in august) and an EKG showed everything was fine. The ED recommended a follow up at my primary care office where an X-ray also showed my lungs and heart were ok. - During this meeting she suggested that my issues sounded GERD related, even though at this point i did not have very many symptoms of GERD. 

In September i slowly started to notice it felt like my throat was clogged, kinda like there was something stuck in my throat even though i haven't eaten anything. I noticed it was similar to if my throat were closing. Then after that, the chest pain in the middle of my chest came back and started getting intense. It was a sharp pain as if i had been stabbed in the left side of my chest, It would travel up and down my body sometimes, sometimes it would stay on either the left or right side of my chest. I also started noticing that i felt like i wasn't getting enough air, like every time i inhaled it wouldn't fully go into my lungs and make it hard to catch my breath. The pressure was intense and seemed to be getting worse and would fade away sometimes but come back at random moments. sometimes with the shortness of breath sometimes with out. I started taking an inhaler in the middle of september that seems to ease the tension and help me catch my breath however the chest pain is still current. I followed up with a doctor at my primary care office again in October with the report of my chest issues previously explained and my throat issue and he perscribed GERD medicine. Taking the GERD medicine i didnt feel as nauseous. but i also realized i felt that way at random times as well. I stopped taking the GERD medicine because i was not sure if i actually had it. I went to the ED again in October and had an EKG, blood Test, and an Xray on my chest after i felt sharp pain from my collar bone down to the bottom of my ribcage. I went and finally saw my primary doctor who said that it does not sound life threatening and perscribed me a new type of inhaler to prevent wheezing, i dont remember the name of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, i feel like i am completely out of options and am tired of going through this. I have been taking the pantoprazole (GERD Medicine mentioned earlier) it seems to take away the nausea feeling but the chest pain and shortness of breath continue. 

(sometimes the pain comes from the right side of my abdomen)

Hello, i’m here again. I’ve been having an asthma flare up that hasn’t gone in a week now. The only symptom I have is mostly shortness of breath. No wheeze. No cough. Etc. But I notice that when I speak my throat feels off and my voice is suddenly hoarse. I also feel like there’s something stuck in my throat, and also a thick phlegm that’s just there. Throat’s not really painful but it’s scratchy and rough. I have been yawning too but I can’t seem to complete it.

I was having a conversation with my sister yesterday and noticed that my voice turned raspy, i also felt like something is pressing on my throat or something. Maybe a little constricted?

I had a covid swab test this week which turned out negative so it’s definitely not covid, just wondering if any of y’all are experiencing the same thing as me.

15,"To start I have not been tested for anxiety or covid, however I feel like my symptoms have been slowly getting worse. They include shortness of breath, occasional diarrhea, higher heart rate than normal. I have asthma which has been well controlled up to the start of August.

To go back, at the beginning of August I was at the gym, I had been going for two weeks and I noticed that I had gotten out of breath faster than I usually did. I didn't think much of it but I went home anyways since I was fatigued at that point. Keep in mind I wasn't even halfway through my workout and I hadn't done cardio, just weights. I stopped going to the gym after that.

August 16th I called an ambulance as I felt like I couldn't breathe. By the time the ambulance arrived I was feeling better waiting outside for them. They took my back and my stats were fine. Seemed I had a panic attack. That was the first time I've ever had one. They sent me on my way home.

Going up to September after that I found myself using my rescue inhaler before bed sometimes and when waking up. I wasn't having an asthma attack, but I could feel some restriction. It was relieved when I took the inhaler. It didn't really worry me, but to be safe I went to doctor to get some flovent and get checked out. He said I was all clear.

Fast forward to September 11th, I took a flight to a different province to live with my dad for a while. Was feeling good up to that point. Second night I was there I noticed a very slight wheeze on exhale. It didn't make me rush to my inhaler but I felt better when I took it and the wheeze went away for a couple hours. This continued for two weeks and I won't deny I was stressed the entire time wondering why I had this wheeze. 

*I should add I do have allergic asthma and the place I was sleeping in used to have dogs around. However usually when I'm on flovent and antihistamines it is well controlled, which I am on.*

After that initial two weeks I began to develop a feeling like I could no longer take a full deep breath, sometimes if I really focused on it and pushed I would get it but other times I would not. I also felt like my normal breathing rate wasn't getting me enough oxygen so every couple minutes I would have to take a deep breath but even then I felt like I wasn't reaching my usual ""max"" inhale. I've been to the hospital three times. The first time I went they said my oxygen was fine. They gave me prednisone just incase but that didn't do anything noticeable. After that visit I felt less anxious but still had the same base line symptoms.

 About 2 weeks later I went to the hospital again this time for a full blown panic attack, the 2nd and worst one I've gotten. I got there and again they said I was okay, but this time they gave me an xray and it came up clear. I went home still and again felt less anxious but still had those base line symptoms but I felt my shortness of breath was a little worse compared to my last visit. 

A couple says after I was doing a little bit of physical labour. I was shoveling gravel for about 5 or 10 minutes but it was intense not laid back. Immediately after that I started wheezing on inhale and exhale and was extremely fatigued. I took my rescue inhaler and it did help. 

I went to the hospital a couple days later because I wanted to get a stronger inhaler, advair, to see if it would help. They again checked my oxygen and blood pressure and said I seemed fine. 

That was a week ago and I have felt at my worst since then. So much so that the last couple days I haven't even been able to sleep properly, I've gotten 2 or 3 hours per night. Last night I got some good sleep but I feel like it's because my body was just totally exhausted from the previous nights of lack of sleep.

Recently I find that I get winded very easily. My heart rate shoots up just by me getting up and walking around. I feel like I cant even get a good deep breath anymore so I just stick to slower more shallow breathing until I feel like I need a deep breath. My rescue inhaler doesn't really help either. It helps a little with anxiety I think but an hour later I feel the same.

I won't deny these last two months this problem has been on my mind 24/7 and is no doubt stressing me to the max and giving me anxiety. I feel better when I'm less anxious but never 100%. This makes me question whether it is just purely anxiety, or a mix of an actual problem with my lungs and anxiety exacerbating it.

My peak flow has remained the same since I started recording it a month ago around 580. It doesn't change when I use the rescue inhaler.

I started taking Singulair and Zyrtec at the same time, and at first it was great! I started sleeping better and I am able to breathe more deeply. I had an allergy panel done earlier this week, and it turns out I’m highly allergic to pretty much all pollen and certain molds (and where I live that means yearlong nonstop allergies). They’re going to start me on allergy shots to build up immunity. Stopping the Zyrtec prior to the test, I realized that a lot of the benefits I’ve been experiencing are probably from the Zyrtec.

I take both at night per my doctor. I’ve found that my anxiety has improved, I’m no longer on the verge of panicking all day long, but I am becoming more and more quick to anger. I wake up so irritable! I’m not a morning person, but this is not normal for me. My poor kids are triggering me so bad. I had to stop drinking coffee (I switched to tea) because it was making it worse. I don’t like who I am right now. I know antihistamines can sometimes help with anxiety, but they’ve never made me agitated before, so I very much suspect the Singulair.

I’m starting ADHD medication soon, but I’m concerned my agitation and irritability will only get worse when I do. I really want to figure this out before adding another drug into the mix.

Have any of you had a similar experience? Was it the Singulair? If you stopped taking it, how long did it take to feel normal again? 

FYI, I’ve been on it for about a month. My asthma has never been severe, and I’ve only recently started been diagnosed (silly me, I thought the past 20 years of sporadic coughing fits was somehow normal).

Basically sometimes my airway randomly constricts, feels really scratchy and feels somewhat mucousy and I can't breathe for like around a minute and start like involuntarily coughing but like with my mouth closed I guess, like they're not complete coughs it's just like my lungs trying to cough, I suppose. Seems to be spurred by nothing, also my eyes water.

I'd never really considered the possibility of it being Asthma, but I recently saw like a diagram of a normal airway versus an airway during an Asthma attack and that looked exactly how I feel like my airway is during these random happenings. They're not too frequent, maybe like once every few months I guess.

I have a doctor's appointment scheduled tomorrow; I'm looking for advice from those of you who have dealt with this, on things to ask about or bring up. Also, looking for general advice - exercises? Things to look out for? Anything? This is such a problem in my life and limits my life.

Suddenly around 9 or 10 months ago, I started getting severe issues with my breathing, being unable to get a full breath for weeks on end. I've always had a strange breathing problem, where I would feel like I can't get a full breath, and would need to yawn in order to get a full breath, but it was mild and more of an annoyance, and would go away after a few days. This year it really ballooned out of control, became very severe and wouldn't go away. Doctor's said it's asthma issues and now I'm on daily steroids (Advair 250/50), as well as my rescue inhaler. Even with all this for over 6 months, my breathing issues persist daily (though not near as bad - the meds definitely help.) However, I will say I tried my nebulizer the first time the other day, and it left my lungs in pain for the rest of the day. I have not tried the nebulizer again.

Recently, I read about vocal cord dysfunction, and started thinking that might be what's going on. The main reason is that I often get a feeling like my throat is closing up, when these breathing issues happen. Sometimes it would happen right after eating, so it scared me from eating and I began losing a lot of weight, because at first i thought maybe I'm having some alergic reaction to my food. Inhalers don't seem to relieve that, but my zyrtec used to help with it. After reading about VCD, I looked up [some exercises](https://azsneeze.com/vocal-cord-dysfunction-breathing-exercises/), and started doing these when I get that feeling, and unbelievably it kind of works. After about 5 or so repetitions, it feels like my throat has ""opened up"" kind of in the back, and I can actually get a full breath. However, it's usually temporary and the closing feeling comes back pretty soon. Another issue I have is often really difficult to swallow; sometimes I can't get food down even when working really hard. It kills my appetite. I've lost so much weight in the past few months, and struggle with being very underweight now. I drink high calorie protein shakes now because liquid isn't a problem.

One thing I will say is, I read VCD seems to happen mostly with atheltes and stuff. None of this is related to exercise. I'm not an athlete, and due to my current situation I actually don't get much physical exercise at all.

I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow morning, a video appointment, and I'm wondering if anyone here has any advice, on things to ask or let them know. Unfortunately due to my situation, I am limited to video appointments, so I can not get a proper diagnosis of this. I read speech therapy is a course here - anything I should bring up and ask about? Also, do you have any advice in general? Thanks in advance if you actually read this, and sorry it's so long. No doctor has ever brought up VCD to me, so I am trying to be as prepared as possible.",Asthma,Any recommendations on doctor's appointment to explore the possibility of vocal cord issues,1605126675

I was diagnosed with adult onset asthma around 21 about 10 years ago. Mild to moderate asthma and generally seasonal. Pretty good during warmer months, only had to visit the hospital 4 times all up over the years.

About last year it seemed to have gotten whole lot worse and so I went and got myself a nebuliser. Previously I’ve managed with just preventers and my trusty inhaler.

As for the nebuliser I very rarely use as I find that I feel absolutely plastered each time after I use it. My muscles are sore , tremors , and my heart rate sits at about 110-120 for over 2 hours.
So as a result I don’t reach for it unless I feel like I really can’t breath.

54,"Hello all!

Disclaimer, this is a long one.

So my son is 8 years old. He's had asthma since he was a baby, but couldn't be ""officially"" diagnosed until he was about 2-3 years old.

He's been put on everything from Flovent, now he's on Advair, Singulair, Flonase, used to be on Claritin, now he's on Zyrtec, Albuterol inhalers as well as albuterol treatments.  His allergist recently prescribed Ipratropium bromide to mix with the albuterol for his treatments when he needs them.  

He has SO many allergies, both to foods, animal dander, and environmental.  And since many of his flare ups are due to environmental triggers, we started him on allergy shots at the beginning of the year.  His allergist said the shots should help improve his allergies, which would then hopefully help his asthma and get him off some of these meds.  

This season is really kicking his butt.  His allergies have been going INSANE over the past few weeks with the season/weather change (I'm in Phoenix, AZ if that helps at all) which in turn has triggered little flare ups here and there, and just overall, him not being able to get a decent breath without the help of his rescue inhaler and albuterol treatments.  We ran through the motions, albuterol treatments as needed (the past week-ish he's been getting them every 4-6 hours) with the ipratropium bromide/albuterol mixture in between.  And they're obviously just band-aids which offer temporary relief. So I took him into the doctor today since he hasn't improved. They put him back on prednisone for the next few days which is no fun, but seems to be the only thing that helps give him that boost back to normalcy.  His doctor said if the prednisone doesn't help, then he'll increase the dosage of his Advair.  He's currently on the lowest dosage of 115-21 MCG.  

We're consistent with his meds, we obviously stay away from foods/animals he's allergic to.  As well as foods that could aggravate his asthma.  We do our best to stay away from environmental allergies, but I mean, unless I put him in a bubble, that's almost impossible.  We change our AC filter probably more often then we should.  We have air purifiers throughout the house, and a humidifier in his room during times like these.  Since COVID we've officially transitioned him to virtual learning, which he hates.  He's such a social butterfly.  But his health is our priority.  There are definitely things that I'm forgetting to put on this list. I just feel like we've tried (almost) all of it.  

He's just so miserable and I HATE not knowing how to help him or help ease some of these symptoms.  And if I hear another person tell me that most kids grow out of it, I am going to lose my mind!!!!  Yes, believe me, I agree that it is great that he'll possibly outgrow it....someday....but on this day my baby is struggling and miserable.

Anyways, if you're still reading (and if you are sorry it's so long but thank you for hanging in there with me till now), I guess I'm here to see if there is anything you guys would suggest after learning a bit about him.  If there's anything I haven't mentioned that's worked for you, or even things that maybe didn't work for you, but you would suggest.  Because who knows, maybe they'll work for him.

63,"Hey everyone, glad I found this community and I hope you’re all breathing easy today. 

Anyways a little background. Im a 22M lifelong asthmatic. Havent been hospitalized since I was probably 8 or 9 but have had asthma for all of my adolescence. 

Anyways I always thought I had a more mild case of asthma, that was aggravated by cat/dog allergies, exercise and cigarette smoke. Nevertheless, I had three cats at home, dads a smoker and I played a lot of sports, just using albuterol before each practice made a world of difference and I was an avid athlete. I used preventative inhalers and spent a lot of time out of the house at school or with friends and as a result I didnt have to use my rescue unless I was triggered by a pet dander at a friends or at my own home. I still probably used my rescue too much because my baseline was at least once every weekday due to sports practices.

Anyways the last four years I have been at Uni and I rarely had to use my rescue at all. I would still use it before exercise but didnt use it otherwise more than once or twice a week. And as classes got more intense, I began to regularly exercise less and less. I just graduated and due to COVID have been living at my childhood home since March...

Guys. This shit sucks. I spend all my time in the house and have to use my rescue to stave off an attack 2-4 times a day. I only recently (august) was put back on a preventative inhaler (alvesco 2puffs twice a day) and while that helped I still had to use my rescue 1-2 times a day. Ive taken more precaution to keep all the animals out of my room (which sucks because I love cats/dogs) and clean it more often to have a sort of sanctuary which has helped too, but its far from solved the issue.

My doctor also prescribed me flonase and singulair and I just started the flonase which I hope will help but I am TERRIFIED to start the singulair since it seems like most of the experiences on here have been very negative with psychiatric side effects and I am an anxious person to begin with, especially about my health. 

And this past weekend I helped dogsit a friend’s house and it sent my asthma into a huge spiral, to the point where I thought I may have COVID after seeing 2 friends that weekend for a few hours. After two negative tests and one of the friends testing negative my PCP is convinced I never had COVID but that the dogsitting aggravated my allergies/asthma and prescribed me 20mg prednisone for 5 days to help get my asthma back to baseline. I havent needed prednisone since I was a little kid when I had my worst attacks and I am scared to take it again. 

TDLR: The things Im stressing over is the possibility Ive already permanently damaged my lungs with how much Ive used my rescue, the anxiety of starting prednisone and singulair, the dread of never being able to live in a city with my GF, the dread of never being able to own my own pets, and the general wheeziness of everything...

Anyways, rant over, thanks for reading if you made it this far. Any tips or experiences with singulair or prednisone would be appreciated.",Asthma,Just a little vent/rant from a lifelong asthmatic. Symptoms have intensified since moving home due to COVID.,1604942522

I have been going to therapy for a couple of months, talking about different topics related to my daily life. So, two days ago in my weekly consult, I talked about my asthma.
Since I have memory, I have suffered from periods of weeks during I can't breathe well. Is not as movies or hard cases that you can hear, I don't stop breathing suddenly, just is harder to get air to my lungs. I lived the biggest part of my life in very cold weather, (it commonly had -5° Celsius) so it was normal that if I went outside without a coat, thee asthma would be present in a few hours or the next day. Now, and since four years, I live in a more tropical place, where the minimum temperature has been 13° Celsius and the average ~30° Celsius, so the asthma is now rare. But the winter is coming and since a week an asthma period as came. So, I related that to my therapist, and coincidentally the day before the asthma period started I discuss with my mother and the therapist pointed that some times the asthma is strongly related with problems with the maternal relationship, but we don't give to much importance to it. So I want to search for more information, but I haven't found on Google. Do you guys know something about the topic or any source to investigate?",Asthma,About the relationship between asthma and maternal relationship issues.,1604864702

74,"So my asthma has never really bothered me too much before. Normally I MAYBE have to use an inhaler once every six months.

This past Wednesday I started packing up stuff to prepare for my move, the only time my asthma gave me a problem was on Thursday when I was packing the truck. I thought “this seems normal because I was running up and down stairs” I lived on the second floor and was really pushing myself. So I used my inhaler once and was fine.

Friday I drove from PA to MI for my move and I was fine the whole drive, didn’t have a problem. Friday night I slept at my new place and I woke up twice and needed to take my inhaler. Saturday during the day I had to take it a few times too. Last night I turned on a humidifier next to my bed hoping it would help, but I woke up three times needing to use my inhaler. This morning hasn’t been so bad, I took a Claritin in hopes that it’ll help.

75,"Hey everyone. So backstory on me, Im 25, female, caucasian, from Ontario Canada. Not on any regular medications but I have a steroid inhaler for emergency use. When I was a baby I had a bronchial infection for a few months and was told it resulted in some lingering athsma symptoms. I had inhalers til I was 3 then I dont recall ever having symptoms again after that. Now Im 25, have been smoking cannabis and the occasional cigarette since I was 16. For the last year/2 I have had chest pain which is supposedly esophageal spasms, diagnosed by scope last fall. I used to have terrible attacks of chest pain that would last for hours. Acid reflux is supposedly the cause so Ive been eating better and Ive managed to go a long time without chest pain and I feel pretty good. 

But now my main problem is my lungs. I have an emergency inhaler for when I cant breathe and I find myself using it every other day right now. It was prescribed (along with an orange daily puffer) in march when I had a chest cold that wouldnt subside, and my symptoms dont really go away now. The orange puffer gave me a throat infection so I quit using it and just used the emergency one when my symptoms flared. I have trouble breathing at night and in the morning. To the point that it makes me panic and I search the house looking for my puffer. It helps instantly and Im fine again but then my airways close up again the next time I go to/get out of bed. I cough up these chunks of clear jelly sometimes. Being outside definitely makes breathing harder. Steamy showers help me cough and clear my airways. 

I also have crazy ass sinuses that get congested and full when I lay down at night or wake up in the AM. I feel like I need to quit smoking weed, my symptoms significantly decrease when I smoke less. But its the only thing that gets me to sleep and helps my anxiety, it also dries up my sinuses at night when my nose is acting like a faucet so Im reluctant. Does anyone have advice for me? Personal tricks and tips? Do I just need to suck it up and quit? Is there long term athsma treatment? Is it copd? I worry that my pot use is the cause of this and that Ill have to change my habits eventually. 

Its hard to see a doctor right now and I have an appt later this month but I really would love some input

87,"(TL;DR at the end)

I’ve had asthma ever since I learned to walk. I remember some of the oldest memories I have were trips to the ER after having an attack, until such time that my parents were able to afford a nebulizer. My other memories would be waking up at 3am to nebulize, or my parents dashing through the highway after forgetting to bring my nebulizer when going out and getting an attack.

It wasn’t until I was 9yrs old when I was placed by my pulmo on Seretide, with nebulizing (Ventar) as my rescue medication. The latter was my bestfriend and I brought it everywhere, but the former was my greatest woe. I was on it until 12/13yrs old until I begged my new physician (we moved so I needed a new doctor) to stop taking Seretide. I attributed my weight gain, acne, attitude problems, and several other issues to it. After which, I was given my Albuterol inhaler as my rescue inhaler.

The major thing that really put me off steroids was the fact that I ballooned up into so much weight (I became obese), which affected my self-esteem. I was even willing to jeopardize my asthma for it. I remember my parents begging me to take Seretide again since my asthma was basically uncontrolled, sometimes puffing for up to three times in a day, but I never budged. It even became so normal for me to develop pneumonia every flu season, that is, from ages 13-20yrs, I was diagnosed at least once a year with mild pneumonia. Ofc during such periods, I would be temporarily placed on oral steroids or back to my Seretide (plus other medications) for a really short period, which I made sure of, until I got better.

The first year I was off from Seretide didn’t really show many issues, I didn’t think using my Albuterol 1-3x a day was even one lol. There was NO way I would be going back to steroids after gaining so much weight! It wasn’t until October of last year, in the middle of my CPA licensure exam, did I finally decide to visit a pulmo again. It was a really important exam, and flu season just started. My asthma was getting worse, I had constant epistaxis, and I absolutely could not bear to fail this exam just because I didn’t get medicated. The pulmo was surprised that I got this far with my asthma being uncontrolled and took no time to put me on Symbicort. He basically scolded me for taking too long to visit a pulmo with the current state of my asthma. Symbicort has been my controller med, with Albuterol still my rescue inhaler, until now.

What were my experiences so far? I never knew life was possible without a nebulizer or puffing with Albuterol constantly throughout the day. My everyday routine before was waking up to nebulize, use my Albuterol when I’m out, and then using my nebulizer before I go to sleep. When I’m lucky, I wouldn’t nebulize right before I sleep. I didn’t think it was even normal to climb up a flight of stairs or walk around the mall without having to use my Albuterol! I could jog for 30mins now without an attack. It’s flu season again, and I do notice my asthma flaring up, but I only managed to use my Albuterol at most, once a week, and it is no way near to developing a pneumonia (godforbid, with the pandemic at hand!). My quality of life has improved so much in ways I couldn’t even imagine. I’m glad I got that scolding from my pulmo last year. 

And as for the weight gain, I’ve managed to lose 30lbs while on steroids! I’m currently at my healthiest weight. In hindsight, I was incredibly misinformed regarding my weight gain. Inhaled steroids didn’t cause weight gain directly, but it did give me more appetite. Said appetite was spoiled with my unhealthy eating habit. It didn’t help that we owned a restaurant, so anytime I was hungry, I indulged myself. After I started intermittent fasting and calorie restrictions, the weight started going off. I’m still on a weight-loss journey until now with around 25lbs left to lose! My acne became better after consulting a dermatologist back when I was around 14yrs old. Right now, I just have a constant skincare routine to help. That and my attitude was probably just my teenage hormones back then.

This has been my journey so far. I was scheduled to visit my pulmo a few months ago, but because of the lockdown, I haven’t. I’m not so worried about it though since, like I said, my asthma has been controlled.

TL;DR: Childhood asthma, and was on inhaled steroids (Seretide) from 9-13yrs, gained weight from increase appetite, stopped Seretide, had uncontrolled asthma with nebulizing and Albuterol to medicate myself everyday. I was in denial for it until last year, already 20 close to reaching 21yrs. Placed on Symbicort. Got better. Lost weight using IF and CICO.

88,"Went to see the doctor after my follow up from my asthma attack and it's not my regular doctor and she was saying that not managing asthma with steroids and other things and only using albuterol increases the risk that albuterol won't work in the hospital and another attack means a risk of intubation.

6,"Hi all, 

I’m a 30 years old and have had mild to moderate asthma since I was 5. 

To give a little back story, I have been on Symbicort since 2008, it pretty much took away all my symptoms so much so that I stupidly smoked quite a bit whilst at University from 2009-2012. 

My asthma has never really prevented me from doing much, I’m allergic to horses cats etc but pretty much always recovered quickly from any attacks. 

Anyway, skip forwards to 2016, my breathing completely plummeted, my steroid inhalers didn’t seem to be doing anything and my rescue inhaler didn’t do much either. I have been to my GP many times, he tried me on Fostair and a short course of oral steroids but nothing is really working. My peak flow is always around 550-600, my spirometry, cheat x-ray and heart test all said I was fine but I’m still having awful symptoms that are keeping me up most nights. 

I can’t take a full deep breath and feel like I’m only exhaling 50% of what I do take in. I also have this horrible bloated feeling which gets much worse after eating and I seem to have lost the ability to cough properly, it’s as if my abdominal muscles can’t contract properly to cough and obviously that’s not ideal for an asthma sufferer as it feels like I am drowning the whole time. I’m quite worried that my respiratory muscles have weakened or I’ve damaged my lungs from the few years of stupid smoking at University, although would this not have been picked up on my spirometry?

I appreciate no one can really diagnose me on here but I’m just looking for any advice or if anyone has been through anything similar. It has absolutely ruined the last 4 years of my life and I don’t want it to ruin the rest of it. I should mention that these symptoms get worse with any alcohol consumption and that I do suffer from anxiety and GERD.

The doctor I saw today prescribed me Singulair and an inhaler. In reading about the side effects of Singulair, it seems a bit sketchy. We’re going to try these meds for 2 weeks and then check in again.

33,"Hey guys, so I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/il0io3/does_it_get_better/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) here a while back regarding constant chest tightness and I wanted to post again because nothing has gotten better. In fact, things have gotten even worse. I’ve taken the Advair, Qvar, and Spiriva inhalers, and none of them have helped. Using my albuterol rescue inhaler gives me exactly zero relief. I have been on Xolair infusions for three months now, and nothing has changed. I’ve also been on a couple of different GERD medications like Pepcid and Prilosec as well, and they do not seem to have helped at all. 

I’ve seen my Primary Care, pulmonologist, and allergist, and I’ve talked to all of them about nothing having improved. My PCP suggested anxiety but if I’m being honest that’s a cop-out diagnosis. This isn’t the result of me over worrying and thinking too much things; this is a physical ailment that none of my doctors have been able to help me with. 

I’ve also seen an Oropharyngeal specialist to explore the possibility of a vocal cord dysfunction, and they put that camera tube thing down my throat and had me talk while it was in, and nothing was out of the ordinary. 

I have not had any relief from this constant and persistent chest tightness, which started back in April 2020. In the past week and a half if has gotten particularly bad, to the point that very very minimal cardio activity (ie, a minute of slow elliptical work) gets me incredibly winded - and I’m someone who used to run 8 miles without a problem. I also get winded just talking to people. 

My difficultly breathing seems to persist wherever I go. I am currently located in San Diego, CA, but I have also travelled to Washington State, New York, and Utah all in the past several months and I still feel the chest tightness wherever I go. 

On top of all of this I have had very excessive fatigue coupled with insomnia and that of course adds to me feeling like utter crap all the time, 24/7. There is no relief from the way I’ve been feeling. It has been like this for months, and has just steadily getting worse. 
I cannot count how many times I’ve cried about this (crying right now, actually). I am someone who loves being physically active, and I take pride in working out, being active with my dogs. And I just cannot do any of that right now. It is so very demoralizing, so very miserable, and I wonder if I will ever feel normal again. I’m only 26, and I feel like I’m in my 70’s. 

I’m not even sure if this is asthma I’m dealing with at this point, especially because my inhalers don’t help at all, and I’m not wheezing at all either. I’m not sure where else to post this, so if someone can point me in the right direction I would be very grateful (sorry if all this seems kinda incoherent, I am super tired and frustrated and needed to vent a bit).


Side note: I got very sick in mid-February 2020, sicker than I ever have since I was a small child. Fever, chills, completely bed ridden for a week, completely exhausted. At the time I thought it was the flu, but now I wonder if I had COVID and just didn’t know it, and this is all the after effects of it.

34,"So I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 3 (20 years ago). I had 2 episodes of asthma in my life that didn't seem like asthma to me. I'm currently in the second one of those and it sucks. Basically, I'm almost always out of breath during those episodes but I don't wheeze and don't cough. Also, my inhaler seems to help a little bit, but not a as much as usual. I also feel like it's heavy to breathe and there's some resistance when I breathe through my nose. My throat feels irritated. Sometimes it seems my nose is wheezing, that's weird. These symptoms seem worse when in the morning and evening. The first time it happened (when I was 16), I went to the hospital and they told me my lungs and oxygen were all ok and they didn't understand why I was feeling that way so they told me to do sinus rinse every day and to continue to take Pulmicort twice a day. It took one month to go away, it was really not fun. For the current episode, I was taking Pulmicort for 3 weeks and I feel that my asthma flare up was gone for the last week. Then, after taking a Naproxen, it seemed like it was back but it looked more like the weird episode I had when I was 16. I was taking Ventolin and it was doing nothing. I went to the hospital and they said my lungs and oxygen levels were all good. They also did a x-ray and said it was fine, so they told me to take FloVent instead of Pulmicort. I feel like my episodes are less long, but it still doesn't seem like asthma to me. It's weird. I'm asking here because I don't have a doctor (I'm on the list but it will take 2 years before it's my turn to get assigned to a doctor). I will try to get to see a pulmonologist if the Pulmicort doesn't help after 2 weeks. I saw some people with similar symptoms mentioning GERD, do you people think it could be a possibility?

 TLDR: I had 2 episodes of symptoms that don't seem like asthma to me: shortness of breath, no cough or wheeze, resistance when breathing through the nose, nose wheezing, irritated throat, heavy when breathing. Doctors say that oxygen levels and lungs are good. First episode lasted 1 month when I was 16. I'm currently on the second of those episodes since 1 week. Does this sound like GERD?

Anyways, besides weed I have always avoided cigarette's but recently with popularity of vapes, sometimes when im out with friends and they offer to hit a puff bar or whatever it is I will literally hit it one or two times and be fine in the moment but the next day or weeks later will notice small difference in lung capacity

2) do you breathe normally through your mouth or deeper? I can’t seem to take deep breaths without coughing.

I have had asthma for almost 2 decades. When Covid started being a thing, I helped my boss make a very quick / low production employee training video on how to use a pulsometer.

In my hospital, they say they ""don't like to give home nebs to young asthmatics"", but being asthmatic has completely taken over my life. In hospital they said my GP could potentially prescribe nebules, but they wouldn't.

I apologize in advance for the format, I am on mobile. 
I (28F) 125lbs, have had asthma since I was 2 years old. Instead of improving, my asthma gets worse and harder to manage each year. I am on Inorial an antihistamine; and the generic of Singulair (have been taking this for 5 years). This past summer I went to a different part of the country where the heat was drier, and when I went back to where I live which is humid, my asthma got really out of control. I had to take prednisone for a week and could barely go up the stairs without being short of breath. 

This is when I remembered my Montelukast had ran out, and I skipped a night and got the refill the next morning. This happened again last week and the morning after not taking the medication, I woke up wheezing with excessive mucus (like choking on it). 

I am worried I have dependency with Montelukast. Does anyone have a similar story where climate change and forgetting one dose of medication throws them out of whack?

97,"Hi! I (21 y/o female) have a healthy background and no underlying medical conditions that I know of. Within the past month or two, I have been experiencing a strange sensation regarding my ability to breathe normally. This sensation is usually present for several days or a week consistently, then it might completely disappear for a few days or a week before returning once again. It feels as though I am not able to obtain a full, satisfying breath of air. I often need to stop what I am doing and yawn in order to get a breath that isn't shallow. This feeling is accompanied with a dull, constant headache on the right side of my head. Once I yawn/open my mouth extremely wide to try to ""gulp"" in air, that small headache is alleviated temporarily until the next episode in which I need a large breath.

 I approximate that I experience this annoying sensation once every minute or two. This happened for about a week on end a month ago, then it went away for a week, returned for a few days, went away again, and I have now been experiencing it once again for about three days in a row. It does not feel painful or like an ""emergency,"" but it seems to be chronic and completely unnatural. I have no known mental health conditions either. I read a bit on this subject and saw that some people believe it can be attributed to anxiety, but I myself do not believe I am anxious whatsoever. Others seem to believe it could have to do with diagnosed asthma. I am not sure whether this is the case for me either, although there is a possibility. I have never experienced any consistent breathing difficulties like this in the past. When I exercise, I definitely feel as though it is difficult for me to breathe normally, but I cannot tell whether that is natural, has to do with my level of fitness, or could be something asthma/breathing related.

My nebulizer by the way only has a mouthpiece that i put in my mouth, no mask.

1. can you swallow during the process? As far as I was aware, you need to press the mouthpiece down on top of your tongue. Throughout the entire thing saliva kept going back in to the mouthpiece and dripping out down the side, tons and tons of it. Won't it just back up in to the medicine? Should you just keep swallowing continuously?

2. It tasted weird. Like oranges or something. is this normal?

3. My lungs hurt a little after taking it. Is that normal? I've never felt anything weird from albuterol rescue inhaler before.

4. How do you really know it's done? My instructions said, when you can't see anymore medicine in the medicine cup, and there's no more mist coming out. But when I would take it away from my mouth, it looked like there were still some drops inside. Moreover, mist would start coming out, but only after 30 seconds or so. Is that how it starts to get when it's running low? Eventually after about 15 minutes I just turned it off because I was unsure.

5. I asked the guy on the phone if i need to clean the pieces before first use, and he said it was ok to just rinse them out and shake them dry. so i did that. but when i was done i looked at the instructions more thoroughly and it says to properly clean it before first use :( now i'm really scared. could i get an infection? i don't have any vinegar, just dishwashing liquid. i'm really scared that i didn't clean this with soap before using it the first time. i washed my hands before touching it myself.

I should probably start this off by saying that, although my asthma (or whatever the hell is wrong with me) isn't severe by any means, I do deal with it daily, and live with animals. I also volunteer at an animal shelter from time to time, and I've had times where I've nearly passed out while alone, so having a working inhaler on me at all times is an absolute must.

Recently, I got a new inhaler as mine was run over by a car. Its from Perrigo, white, has a red cap, and has a clear plastic shield over the front of it. Aside from struggling a bit to get the actual canister out to clean it, its... Not working. It'll work for maybe... Say, five minutes or so? And then my breathing is back to its normal thickness again. On top of that, it tastes *rancid.* I mean, seriously? The only thing I can compare it to is a cesar salad that's gone off for about a week. Even washing my mouth out doesn't alleviate the rancid taste, and I've now developed a small rash on my lip, presumably because of it.

I got my allergy testing done this week, and I had a severe reaction to it. I was getting the subcutaneous injections in my arm, and by the time the tech finished the last injection I felt awful. 

They have me Benadryl and ice packs, but I wasn’t able to get off of the exam table for a good 40 minutes without feeling like fainting. I felt better so I left the clinic, but I passed out when I got down to the lobby. They called the EMTs and I spent the night in the hospital. 

I got fluids and Benadryl in the hospital. They also checked out my heart because I mentioned chest pain, and I had an elevated D-dimer. My heart tests all came back normal except for non-specific T wave abnormalities on my EKG. They sent me home on a telemetry monitor. 

I’m worried about having another reaction at home. I’ve noticed I’m more sensitive to the allergens in my house now (I have 2 cats). I got super itchy all over the last couple nights at home, and that never used to happen.

48,"Hello everyone,

I was just diagnosed a couple days ago with asthma. I’ve had intermittent mild attacks since my teen years, but never realized they were asthma attacks until the one I had last week. I feel silly about that... I really thought those awful fits were normal because my triggers are pretty distinct as irritants (smoke, dust, pollen, frigid air, etc). I used my  son’s nebulizer albuterol and felt immediate relief, and saw the doctor the next day.

 I have also suffered from nasal polyps for at least the last 8 years, and they have grown much worse as of late. I never realized there was such a strong correlation between the two conditions! I’m learning so much.

My attacks have never been frequent... maybe once a month? Maybe more often? I never really paid much attention before because I thought they were just coughing fits (as if that’s perfectly normal!). I’ve had 2 in the last 3 weeks. 

I now have a rescue inhaler (Albuterol) that I doubt I’ll need to use all that often. I started taking Singulair and Zyrtec at night which has helped a lot! I can breathe so much more deeply now. I had no idea my ability to take deep breaths was so diminished. I’m sleeping better, and my horrible anxiety is actually much less than usual (totally unexpected!).

Today I picked up Symbicort and wow... those side effects sound terrifying! I’m not convinced I need it, but I’m pretty naïve regarding my condition, so that may be the fear talking. What are your thoughts on this drug? I’m scared to take it, so I haven’t opened the box yet.

I have some sort of breathing test next week, and possibly a referral to a specialist after that. I think I’m going to press for that referral since my polyps don’t seem to be resolving... I keep fighting off sinus infections despite daily sinus rinses and Flonase use.

I’ll be reaching out to my doctor, but I’m curious to hear what people with experience with this condition have to say? Opinions, thoughts, feelings, useful information, etc?

All of my life I have been using Ventolin Nebules whenever my asthma acts up but I don’t own any emergency nor maintenance inhalers. I don’t remember the last time I have been to a doctor to have me checked about my asthma. I think. was diagnosed at around 3-5years old. My asthma only flares up with 2 things, change of weather and when I have a cold.

I know, for an asthmatic like me, It doesn’t sound like I even have asthma but trust me, it runs in my blood. Almost all of my cousins have asthma as well as my sister. My wheezes are so bad, I can’t sleep at night and it feels like there’s too much phlegm in my lungs that there’s no enough air going in. No matter how much I try to eject the phlegm, it doesn’t help.

My question is are there any other people who is in the same situation with me? An asthmatic person, that only has suffered 2 *assumed* asthma attack her whole life and has NO INHALERS AS THEIR ASTHMA MEDICATION? Most people, especially my PE teachers don’t believe me because I don’t own any inhalers lol. Plus it has been a year since my last asthma flare up, is it possible that I’ve outgrown it?

 I was never brought to the hospital in any of my asthma flare ups. I remember crying while finding my missing nebulizer when I was 10 and recently at 16yrs old, hiding my tears while walking upstairs until 5th floor in school because I couldn’t breathe. 

You may ask why I was never brought to the hospital. First, I try to hide it when I’m having difficulty in breathing since I don’t want to catch their attention or anything and I also don’t like the idea of people pointing out on my weight telling me that’s the reason why I couldn’t breathe (when in reality I do have asthma)

4 weeks ago I got a cough, had a tight chest and was sent home from work for a covid test, it was negative. Since then, my asthma has been awful, a constant tight chest, having to breathe in really deeply to feel like I'm getting enough air and a really disgusting, dry cough. I've had 2 more covid tests and they were both negative 

I rang the doctor who prescribed montelukast. I gave it 2 weeks and my chest was still tight so I rang the doctor who prescribed 5 days of prednisolone. I finished that at the weekend. Yesterday I felt as it my reliever inhaler was not working at all, I rang the doctors surgery who told me to go straight to urgent care.

They took my blood pressure and peak flow, which were normal. I had a nubiliser and a chest xray, the chest xray came back as normal. 

The doctor said it was a viral infection but not covid, could take 8 weeks to go and gave me antibiotics to keep any infections at bay (?). 

I have found that if I lay down, I have no tightness in my chest at all. 

I'm getting stressed now. Although I've had asthma my whole life, it's always been very well controlled, i didnt even have to take my preventer inhalers every day if I was being naughty because asthma just didn't affect me much unless I had a cold, hay fever etc.
 Its affecting my work so much, I've had so many days off this past month and although my employers are being incredibly supportive, I know this isn't ideal for me or them!

The test results dont lie, but I'm still out of breath frequently. I have no signs of heart failure either.

I have tried all forms medicine forms be it homeopathy, allopathy etc.

Recently I tried accupunture from some experienced therapist and it really gave me relief for 3-4 months. I could actually live without nebulizer in my pocket and other medicines. 

Therapist specifically asked me not to eat sour food products, food made from milk like curd, buttermilk and Banana, rice etc amd food and drinks which have preservatives like cola, sodas, box juices etc

For the first 20-25 days I followed that diet but then being free from this childhood restrictions I was so happy i became care free and started consuming everything I missed all these years. Therefore the effect only lasted few months and I am now thinking again for having a session and be careful this item.

So the best effect i had from accupunture was that my body stopped producing excess phelgum which it was initially doing. Therefore resulting in congestion in my lungs and air passage. The needle points used were on both of my ear's tip, space between finger and thumb on both hands and one needle in between chest and then slow passing of electrical current opened my clogged air passage.

I have a question for you all. Up until earlier this year, I would have considered myself a mild asthmatic. Prior to 2018, I was on Symbicort once a day, but stopped taking a steroid at the end of 2018. For the last year and a half, I didn't use a steroid... however, this summer I found that my chest was getting worse, and I needed my blue at night (on occasion). Now I take 1 puff of Clenil Modulite morning and evening. I also take one puff of blue (Salbutamol) before I exercise.

Now, something I've noticed is that when I've not taken a puff of blue (so most of the time), my breathing sounds slightly louder on the inhale and exhale, and when I exhale with my mouth open, there is a tiny high pitched sound that sounds like it comes from my throat and less my chest. Does anybody else have this? Please ask for clarification if you don't know what I mean. It concerns me that my breathing sounds better when I take my blue inhaler.

Basically, I’ve been diagnosed with asthma or anxiety by different doctors over the course of my lifetime because of my breathing and I really don’t know anymore. I first was diagnosed with asthma at age 6, (it was super mild, only needed an inhaler about once a year with sports), then with anxiety/hyperventilation at 12, then with asthma again at 20, then with anxiety/hyperventilation again at 20 as well. It would be annoying but would make sense if the consensus was that I had anxiety AND asthma, but each doctor/psychiatrist is always sure that I have one and not the other. 

I called my insurance’s advice nurse last night because I thought I was having an asthma attack, and and after consulting an ER doctor she told me to come in immediately because I was having an exacerbation. I get there, and “nope, chest x-rays clear, you’re just hyperventilating”. 

I had a follow up appointment from the ER visit this morning and the doctor on call told me that my symptoms are most consistent with anxiety and to follow up with my primary care doctor. 

My primary care doctor (who diagnosed me with asthma earlier this year) is pretty sure that I have anxiety- triggered asthma since albuterol does help sometimes, but told me that we would do more extensive testing to know for sure, and also set me up with an emergency psychiatry appt (since the current wait time for them now is literally 2 months).

I have a new Dr who is adamant that my asthma flare ups are due to my parents' pet dog.

I get flare-ups whenever I have a viral infection or during stressful periods (I have anxiety which I believe is the biggest trigger for my asthma). I notice my dog allergy when I'm around other people's pets, because I get my asthma symptoms plus hay fever type symptoms.

My previous Dr was a gem, and supported my hypothesis that my stress was the biggest trigger. NB I saw him while at uni, living away from the dog, when my asthma was still flaring up. My new Dr has been very dismissive and rude, and does not believe that stress has anything to do with my health. She clearly thinks I'm a moron for living with a dog and is encouraging me to get rid. I'm now being pushed into doing blood tests to check for dog IgE.

I know my medical history, and I have no reason to suspect that this dog is the root of my health issues. I have no allergy symptoms at home, and I can match my asthma flare-ups throughout my life with periods of stress (starting school, exam season, new job etc) or viral infections - and my other Drs have agreed with me on this.

63,"Hi everyone,

So, I've been freaking out a little bit over the last couple of weeks. I'm 25, my BMI is exactly where it should be, but I lived a very sedentary lifestyle (no exercise really) between the ages of 17 - 23. For the last two years or so, I haven't been on any form of steroid inhaler, and only used my reliever before exercise. Over the last couple of months since Coronavirus started (I did also have a bronchitis type infection in February, could have been Corona, who knows.), I have found myself feeling 'breathless'. I went to the doctor, I've had bloods done (they were fine), and I've been put on 1 puff of Clenil Modulite morning and evening. 

Now, I'm not entirely sure if I am breathless, or if its all in my head. I'm very 'conscious' of my breath, and I can focus on it quite a lot sometimes. These are my symptoms:

1) I 'feel' out of breath when getting of the sofa. I'm not sure if this is breathlessness, or I notice an increase in my respiration rate because I've gone from sitting to standing.

2) I have a VERY minor audible wheeze when I open my mouth wide and exhale gently... I don't THINK it comes from the lungs, but it does disappear when I take a bronchodilator, which does concern me. 

3) I live in an apartment building, and my flat is on the second floor. It's 60 stairs to reach my floor. If I run/walk up the stairs to my apartment, I can be left out of breath for a couple of minutes. Is this normal?

4) One further example: yesterday I walked up a hill which is 1.1 miles in total. The whole way is a hill and it's relatively steep. At the top of the hill I was quite out of breath and felt pretty weak, I waited 11 minutes to see if my breath would come back, and it got a bit better but I didn't seem to recover super well. I took 1 puff of my blue inhaler and I seemed to recover quite quickly. Firstly, it concerns me that I need to take a puff just from walking up a long hill, and it bothers me that I need to take it before exercise otherwise I feel pooped.

But with the wildfires in my state I started having a lot of trouble. My doctor told me a few weeks ago when the air was really unhealthy that if I needed, it was safe to take my inhaler more often than the every 4-6 hours it says on the box. 

The air is a lot better now but starting yesterday afternoon it feels like I’m having continuous problems.

Usually if I have asthma it’s mild, just a little coughing, feeling irritation in my chest and tightness, and some wheezing. Now with these attacks, it feels like I’m actually struggling to breathe. I kept waking up every hour or two, and I had to sit up and use my whole body to move air which also made me cough so hard I could barely inhale. Good thing was the inhaler still worked very fast, but I lost count how much I used it.

I’m a lot better now. Just a little tired and chest hurts, but now I wonder if I was really stupid and maybe I should’ve gotten my parents to take me to the hospital. Just wasn’t sure where the line was because the inhaler was working, just not for long enough? 

I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday anyway so this is kind of just a rant. I hope this is not the new normal for me because I would be really frustrated.

88,"Hi, as a heads up, I'm a student from the UK and get my asthma medication/appointments through the NHS.

TLDR: I want to ask for a combination inhaler instead of the brown one (beclometasone), because I need my reliver 3-7 times a week, even when doubling the dosage as instructed by my GP. Is it okay to ask this, or is it a bit ""self-diagnose-y""?

When I came to uni, I was away from allergen triggers at home, and I got myself prescribed a brown inhaler  (beclometasone) which made my asthma pretty well handled, until I caught a bad flu in March 2019 (pre-Covid) and ended up needing to take prednisone, which I've never had to do.

Since the flu, I've stuck to the same inhaler thinking ""oh I'm just recovering"" or ""I'll wait a little longer,"" meanwhile needing my reliver inhaler minimum 3 times a week, or on a bad week, everyday.

Two months ago, I made an appointment about it, and got told ""try doubling your dosage on the same inhaler for a couple days, see if that helps, and buy a spacer"" and I did this for a week, and then another week intermittently doing the double dose.
Nothing changed, and I never called back because I was hoping there was a delayed effect, especially because I started consistently using my spacer and was hoping coming back to uni would also help.

Now I'm still needing my reliever minumum 3 times a week, with recent weeks being particularly bad (once a day) because of the heaters being on and drying out the air.
I bought a cold mist humidifier for night time, which does help calm my lungs and somewhat help with the horrible dry nose/throat stuff going on, but not the wheezing randomly throughout the day.

My instinct is that this brown inhaler just isn't effective anymore. That said, any time I've missed a dose, my lungs are noticeably much worse. But I'm not sure if a combination would be more suitable for me based on what I've been reading on here.

That said, is it okay to ask my GP for a combination inhaler, or is that a bit ""self diagnose-y""? I just don't want to get told to double my dosage again, because it genuinely made no difference, even when I tried doing it for longer than asked, and it feels like a waste of medication/money if the double dose does nothing.

But I also just forget to take it.

The reasoning is a bit complicated lol, so I'll try to explain it.

1. I have a hard time swallowing pills. Only one of my meds has to be swallowed, and it *literally* burns my mouth if it starts to dissolve in my mouth.

2. We have a water softener, which makes the water taste gross and salty, and only one faucet in the house is non-softened, and that's upstairs in the kitchen. My bathroom is downstairs.

3. I have a much harder time swallowing pills with straight water (especially when it tastes bad) than with something flavored.

4. Before I was working from home, I had all my meds in the bathroom where I'd take them in the morning. I had trouble with this, as mentioned.

5. Now I'm working from home, and I've got my other meds by my desk, so I just take them when I get my tea/breakfast for the morning. 

6. This means I'm not in a place to ""rinse and spit"" after the inhaler anymore.

7. I have ADHD. This means 2 things: I think ""oh, I'll just remember to take the inhaler with me when I get up to go to the bathroom next"" and then I'll *completely forget* about that. Also, setting something out ""where I'll see it"" does not work at all, because my brain treats things that have been in the same place for longer than like a day as just ""part of the background"" and completely ignores them 😑

So I've been considering adopting a cat. What makes it complicated, though, is that I have fairly severe allergic asthma. Like, so severe that I am maxed out on medications I can take, get 2 shots of Xolair every 2 weeks, get 4 allergy shots every 2 weeks, take 2 daily inhalers, take Zileuton (basically singulair on steroids...not actually, though) daily, and am on a daily antibiotic.

To answer your first question, yes I am allergic to cats and dogs. I've also previously been allergic to rabbits and horses. However, I have lived the majority of my life around cats and dogs. I live in Alaska, away from my family and friends, and am feeling fairly lonely and want some sort of animal companionship- my apartment building, however, does not allow dogs at all hence my resorting to cats. My question is, however, do the health-related costs of getting a cat outweigh the mental/emotional benefits? I know this probably won't help my case, but this is also the first time I can remember in my 27 years of living that my lungs are actually functioning without any obstruction/at 100% capacity. Typically, my lungs only worked at 80-85% of their capacity, but living without pets the last couple of years and changing allergy meds has helped.

I never ever seem to cough with my asthma, but I worry that my 'breathlessness' is something that I should be concerned about. For example, when I walk up 60 stairs in my apartment block, I feel winded and might be breathing harder for around 3-5 minutes... not super hard, but definitely harder than when I'm sat in a chair. Or another example, when I have sex for half an hour, I feel a bit winded and it might take me 5 minutes or so to return to my normal breathing pattern. Is this normal for a 'normal' person or is my delay in getting my normal breath back part of asthma?

I'm very nervous to exercise without taking my inhaler first, but I've been told by an asthma nurse that I should try to exercise without it, and then if I need it, take it... says that it will let me gauge if my asthma is getting better/lungs are getting stronger. I would appreciate  any advice on this front, and if you would like any more information, please let me know!

26,"I wanted to vent a bit. I hope that’s OK.

Last week I was diagnosed with COVID-19 after being tested by our local health department. It started initially with just my partner and I having cold-like symptoms and spiraled in to a living hell quickly. On top of having three asthma attacks this week, I have had a litany of symptoms, including a extreme fatigue, fever, headache, body aches, chills, coughing, sore throat, congestion, nausea, diarrhea, and general shortness of breath. Aside from asthma and a few other occasionally annoying conditions (IBS and PCOS), I’m a relatively healthy woman in my mid thirties. My asthma has always been moderate and I’ve been learning to manage it better as I get older. 

I feel like I got hit by a truck. Every night, I go to bed hoping that tomorrow will be a better day, but my symptoms haven’t improved much (aside from the fever, chills, and diarrhea). None of my doctors can’t really seem to fully explain what’s happening to me or when I’ll get better. My PCP believes that my lungs are inflamed due to the virus and my immune system not knowing what the fuck to do. 

This has been triggering my asthma like crazy, even though I’m not being exposed to my normal triggers. It just seems to happen randomly. I feel like I can breathe in three out of four breaths before I try to take a breath in with literally no results- no air going down my nose, mouth, or throat. My throat feels clogged and tight. It feels like I have a clump of mucus blocking my airway. My chest gets tight and I get a stabbing pain randomly in my left side, along with general soreness. It got so bad tonight I thought that I needed to call an ambulance. The panic from not getting any air in and the pain in my chest put me in tears, which obviously did not help the situation. 

My partner drove me to the ER and we were there for about eight or nine hours. The experience was frustrating. They started with a lot of blood work and x-rays. The good news is that there’s not any obvious damage to my heart and I do not have pneumonia. They then gave me a breathing treatment after having another bad attack while I was there, put me on a very strong anti-inflammatory pain medication, and prescribed me oral steroids. While I was there, my blood oxygen levels kept dropping to the high 70s and low 80s. I have never used a blood oxygen pulsometer before tonight, but I was provided with one at the hospital and was sent home. I was told that I needed to continue to rest and take my medication, and that it was very typical for even young healthy people to have their oxygen levels drop that low for short periods of time. They told me to come back if it lasted longer than 10 to 15 minute increments and that the inflammation/virus is triggering the asthma attacks. Their advice and treatment was not very reassuring. 

My regular PCP is good, but I wish that he and the other doctors had more answers and a treatment. I feel incredibly scared that I’m going to have another attack that will send me to the ER (and leave me with a very hefty bill... tonight’s bill will likely be in the $500 to $750 range), or worse- that I won’t be able to get medical attention in time. 

I don’t feel like I know what to do. When I take my albuterol inhaler, it feels like it takes an eternity to work (30 minutes, which feels like forever when you can’t breathe well). The ER doctors recommended a nebulizer, but that I should talk to my PCP about it first. I’ve never used one before. I’m hoping that the added steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs will work, but I’m skeptical. It’s hard to get out of that head space when every day feels like a struggle to just barely function. I struggle to walk up the stairs, and I’ve gotten out of breath just unloading my dishwasher and bringing in groceries that were dropped off.

41,"I have mild/moderate asthma and have my entire life. I also have a long list of allergies, many of which are part of nature which I dearly love. I moved last year to a new part of the US where my asthma flared up a lot. I thought my asthma was getting worse and worse and just succumbed to it as where I am now I can tangibly see pollen. I’ve been working from home since August 2019 and had been in a very stressful and unhealthy relationship during that time as well. It all ties in I promise. 

So essentially: new environment, could barely breathe, lots of allergies, wfh-using my tiny laptop 8 hours a day, and just overall not having a good time. 

Cut to this month: I’ve started jogging a bit, still wfh but now I have a standing desk and multiple monitors, on proper meds for allergies, single, and I’m working on developing better breathing habits BECAUSE...-drum roll- I wasn’t standing up properly. 

I didn’t stand up properly before I moved, but because I was curling my spine so much to look at my computer I was cutting my breathing room down even more. Then as I got more stressed with life, I just slouched more and more. Just a few weeks ago I realized I was only breathing in what felt about 20% of my lungs. I visited a chiropractor who commented on my posture and how it would help a lot across the board if I was able to focus on having a straighter back. 

Since I’ve been focusing on my posture I feel like I had been trying to breathe with wool over my mouth. It’s so much easier, I can breathe more completely, deeply, and it just feels like better quality. I haven’t used my inhaler since I started focusing on this.

86,"Tl;dr - Asthma got really bad, but now a lot better. Still a bit to go, but hopeful for the future. 

So last few months were pretty tough where at the worst point I was using my rescue 4 to 8 times a day.

Since then I've been on this reddit taking in all info people were just giving out freely and some of the tips have helped massively!

I am now seeing three specialists in the same hospital (pulmonologist, allergist and dermatologist) to really get a grip on and improve my quality of life.

Anyway, I've been sharing the bad, so now I also wanna share the good.

Since the 4-8 times rescue period I've switched maintenance inhalers, which helped to reduce rescue inhaler use to 2 - 6 times a week! It's not completely good yet (I used to hardly need it with my maintenance, so I wanna get back to that).

I took note of everything for 3 months. Side effects from my new inhaler are pretty annoying and the pulmonologist really listened to my experience and took into account my preference for type of inhaler as well to find a new combo that should work the same, but hopefully minus the side effects.

I also got a pulmonary function test and turns out my lungs were actually pretty good, just inflamed (it's 120% compared to others my age/height).

A lot of my worries have been eased in the meantime. I had a list of about 50 questions of which at least 80% was answered. 

These past two weeks got a bit worse again, but not too bad (a bit wheezy and still coughing, but can walk a lot).

The dose I'm on now is about 25% of the max dose they prescribe, so there is still room to play there and I'll probably go to 50% soon. The difference with just the 25% dose was already enormous, just not entirely there yet, so I have high hopes for a bit higher dose to get me back to normal again with only needing the daily maintenance inhalers.

Other than that I've made some changes in the house and there are more to come (mainly to remove as much dust mite-possibilities and pet dander as possible within the next couple months). If I don't get sick again it should be fine again in a couple of months.

Can't wait to be able to stop thinking about breathing again! Thanks to everyone who shared their tips and tricks and general info.

The tips that helped the most:

- get a peakflow meter.

- keep an asthma diary.

- write down all questions and ask them to a pulmonologist.

- know that there are different treatment options and if one doesn't work, another could.

- when possible - cardio.

- allergy-friendlify your home as much as possible.

- learn all there is to learn about your condition so you can go in depth at the appointments with a doc to get all the rest-issues addressed.

- Gp's can be nice, but don't seem to know enough about asthma when you need more than the basics. An expert in the field is a better use of time.",Asthma,Good news!,1601300199

Anyway, the point to this post is that I’ve only been diagnosed with asthma for half a year, and already I’m being bombarded with unsolicited ‘advice’ about how to better manage my asthma, or even ‘cure’ it (lol), from several family members and family friends, which tends to include ignoring the doctors advice and that inhalers are bad for you and make your condition worse. I’m sure they mean well, but this instils a great deal of fear in me especially when the diagnosis it’s still recent and it’s something I’m only just learning to live with.

As an asthmatic, the risk of getting COVID-19 and the flu at the same time concerns me.

Just curious, have you guys been advised by your doctor to get any extra vaccines in response to extra risks posed by the pandemic? 

A little bit of a PSA, please don't delay getting your flu jab and remind your loved ones to do so as well:

19,"Hey all, it has been a second since I posted here. 

I have been struggling with worsening of my preexisting asthma for over a year now. I was already taking singulair and a low dose of flovent daily, with albuterol as needed, for about ten years or so. Then I got put on a higher dose of flovent. Then, within the past 6 or 7 months, I was prescribed advair, zyrtec, and flonase under the belief it was allergic asthma. Then, I got my advair bumped to the highest dose. I'm having to do 60mg prednisone bursts about once a month now, and I'm taking albuterol every single day, multiple times a day. The last round of prednisone I had to take was for a flare caused by taking a walk around my block. 

On top of asthma and general fatigue, since about three months ago, I have had mysterious hives, worsening sinusitis, and weight loss.

I just got blood allergy tests done for just about every allergen you can imagine- and it turns out, I'm actually allergic to less that I thought. The part that is super confounding is that I can't stop taking Zyrtec, or I break out in hives, get stomach discomfort and nausea, and my asthma gets worse. 

My doctor is now talking about biologics, since my asthma has been upgraded from moderate to severe. I am also waiting to hear from a pulmonologist, because my allergy doctor thinks I may not even have asthma, but something else that is causing it.

My blood tests for eosinophils, kidney function, and basically everything else have consistently come back fine. I'm otherwise a really healthy person in that regard. My allergist and primary care doctor seem to be totally stumped by what's happening.

I failed to not let my anxiety run away and spiral, and ended up trying to do my own research on what it could be. This led me to read about Churg-Strauss syndrome, which sounds a lot like what's happened to me. Most people with this condition have asthma that suddenly gets worse, have been on an antileukotriene long term, have asthma that pretty much only responds to corticosteroids, have chronic sinus problems/pain, unexplained weight loss, and hives that don't have a known cause. All of this typically happens in the first phase of this condition. Churg-Strauss is also characterized by an increase in eosinophils, but this can happen sometimes years after the condition starts. 

I feel a little nuts to speculate about something like this, but this does sound uncannily like what I've been going through. I've read that this condition can take up to ten years to progress to the next phase, and is really difficult to pinpoint until then. 

So TL;DR - Has anyone else here ever had their Asthma turn out to just... not be Asthma? Specifically Churg-Strauss/EGPA, but really, I would just like to know if other people have experienced anything similar to this.

27,"Hello All!

Some quick background info, I have had asthma since I was 3, in 2016 when I was 18 I was hit with a pretty nasty chest infection, since then my lungs haven't felt the same, It struck again in October 2018 when I had the worst chest infection of my life, bedridden for 4 weeks I thought I was going to die.   


Since 2016, I have had this feeling that the right lung or right side has some kind of blockage and or wheeze, my left side seems to be completely fine - just an occasional wheezing but NOTHING like the right. If I turn my head to face to the left and breathe it I can hear a high pitched whistle, if I face the left I get barely anything.   


Is it possible to have asthma in one lung only? I have had several chest x-rays and a CT scan to examine my lungs but everything comes back normal, once I was given the all clear I thought surely it would go away but it hasn't, it's now starting to make me a little anxious?   


The only possible thing they found was 'mild bronchial wall thickening' which is obviously caused by my asthma. Has anyone else experienced this feeling of needing to clear something from one side of your lungs?

34,"For the last month and a half I’ve been suffering tremendously. In early August, I was having a lot of short of breath so I decided to purchase a nebulizer machine since a doc already prescribed the meds. Long story short, I took the medication incorrectly. I started doubling my dosage and taking it 2 to 3 days a day every time I experienced shortness of breath. As a result I got heart palpitations lasting several minutes at a time, chest pain, shortness of breath ( non asthma) and tremors. The unfortunate thing is that none of these have subsided since they started in early August and I’ve been in hell ever since. I’ve had countless EKG’s, chest X-ray’s, blood tests, and Echocardiogram and everything has come back normal. No one can tell me why these symptoms still persist even though I completely slowed done on the Albuterol (wasn’t fully educated on do’s and don’t). My doc prescribed Metoprolol 50mg but that didn’t help. The dose was too high and it gave me negative side effects. Now my doctors new guess is I have anxiety. How is that possible if I never had anxiety before nor have I ever experienced this before. So she prescribed Buspar 7.5 mg and it causes terrible headaches and doesn’t relieve any symptoms. At this point at my wits end, my doctor hasn’t been any help. I’ve been back in fourth to the doctors due to constant chest pain. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Finally, after connecting the dots with various doctors and specialists, but also various tests like endoscopy, barium swallow and many more to eliminate possibilities,  I am now diagnosed with H. Pylori given the results of the endoscopy. 

I met with my pulmonologist today, and he was very proud at how far i’ve come with my asthma since basically everything was great... small airways, capacity etc. 

In other news, it has been my gastrointestinal problems which have been making my asthma seem much worse and that was the conclusion. Now, that problem has a name, and it’s H. Pylori. 

There’s many complications and lots of stuff i still do not understand about H. Pylori, tomorrow is my appointment with my gastro doctor. 

Even so, I wanna know if anyone else has this... my pulmonologist was positive that once the bacteria was eliminated, my asthma would be resolved too or at least very to a point where I can live happily again. 

H. Pylori caused me severe bloating, constipation and constant burping. I don’t know how long i’ve had it but it seems it can go undetected for years and then notable symptoms suddenly activate to a point where you cannot ignore them. 

The ncbi.gov says “pylori infection may elicit a Th1-mediated immune response, which suppresses Th2 responses. The lack of adequate stimulation of the Th1 might result in an overactive Th2, which in turn lead to asthma 10. Moreover, the acquisition of H”. 

In conclusion, I wonder if Pylori caused my asthma in the first place... or maybe along the way I got infected with it. In the end, im happy that Im finally connecting the dots.

I have a magnesium chloride supplement oil. Supposed to be good for sleep and muscle aches. I usually spray it on my legs. The other day I sprayed it on my chest and hopped in the shower. I also forgot to use my inhaler. 30 minutes later I was breathing better than I have in a year. This affect lasted roughly 8 hours.

I recall magnesium sulfate being used in inhalers (maybe the older ones). But not chloride. Also, I didn't understand how it could work. If you look online, it's hard to find research that mention chloride specifically. I'll save you the time:  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1977337/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1977337/)

Tested on rabbits.

Naturally, today, I tried spraying magnesium all over my chest/lung area. It didn't work. Or, if it did, I didn't notice it. Then I thought it might have been related to the shower. So I took a hot shower and before I got out I was breathing amazingly again. I can't tell you how much better it is. I'm convinced now that the hot shower must be aerosolizing the oil and making it easier to inhale. The bottle says to be careful of mucus membrane contact and, indeed, if you spray a lot and inadvertently sniff what's in the air it'll sting...a lot. But perhaps the shower created a temporary diluted vapor chamber.

I guess I'll try an oil diffuser. Maybe this is a known remedy, I have no idea. I got my inhalers in France, for $25, whereas in the states they are easily ten times that so I haven't gotten new ones yet. So this is not only more economically, but it's also dramatically more effective without any real side effects like jitters. The oil can  cause you to break out directly sprayed on the skin, hence I'm thinking of the diffuser.

So I (22F) have had excersized induced asthma since I was around 7. It gets bad when I get sick or have allergies. 

Well, for about a month now, I’ve been having trouble breathing on and off. I would wheeze really badly and it would affect my ability to do my summer retail job. Now, I take montelukast and allergy drops under my tongue (in place of allergy shots) on a daily basis and have been for 4 years. I also have my rescue inhaler. I thought I just had allergies when the wheezing started so I was on over the counter allergy meds but it didn’t stop. I went to see a doctor and they put me on prednisone. I got a chest x-ray, too, and everything came up clear. The prednisone helped, but my breathing got worse again (way worse than it was in the first place) after I stopped taking the medication. I’m talking not even being able to walk without wheezing terribly and gasping for air. I also experienced tension and tightness in my chest.

So I went back to the doctor and got on a z pack and another antibiotic since they figured I had bronchitis (which could have been a possibility since I’ve had it in the past) and they seemed to help. 

A few weeks ago, I started a new job as a long term substitute teacher. I went to my allergist and he put me on Flovent, which I’m still on. The bronchitis/infection was gone and my breathing was okay. We are doing a hybrid model so I see some of my students in person in really small groups and we have to wear masks. Well, this past week I started wheezing really badly and started being out of breath after simply talking for two seconds. I went to visit my doctor a couple days ago and she gave me a nebulizer at the office and put me on prednisone again—I do think it could be allergies this time because of the high pollen and sudden temperature change in my area. Well, I’m taking 7 different meds now (montelukast, allergy drops, flovent, prednisone, generic allergy meds, inhaler/proair, mucinex) and I’m STILL wheezing and coughing up phlegm. Not to be TMI but it feels stuck in my throat like all the time and it’s causing me to wheeze. Maybe that’s part of me getting better because it has to come out sometime, but I can’t do my job like this. I can’t teach my students like this. 

I have a dehumidifier and am trying to get a nebulizer from my doctor, and I’m getting those mask bracket things that keep the mask away from your face. I don’t know what else to do and feel totally hopeless as to why this is happening to me :( I had to leave work today because I really was struggling to try to breathe and I couldn’t talk at all without wheezing and was wheezing when I wasn’t talking (still am). I’m just so frustrated that this has to happen to me and that I have to be in school this way. I’m a first year teacher too, and do not want to quit because I love teaching and don’t want to look bad for future employers. As much as I love being in person with my students, I wish I could be at home. My asthma is just making everything bad right now, and covid and everything is making everything so much worse. (For the record, I have not gotten tested for covid but my father, who lives in the same house as me, is a state worker and has gotten tested for it multiple times with all negative results.

I recently started included cardio in my workouts after nearly two years of not including cardio in my routine (I know, terrible). I have done an at home spin class four days in a row (easy-ish.

76,"Hi all,  


As of late I've been having a rough time with asthma. I had been prescribed a pretty unlimited amount of budesonide and albuterol to nebulize whenever i had a flare when i was younger and it worked fine up until this year, when things got rough and I kept having to bounce back to that treatment. As a result, new allergist tried to prescribe me Symbicort to see if that would help my lungs recover. Unfortunately, Symbicort seemed to make me feel terrible. Blood sugar was uncontrollable, constantly aching, panic attacks frequently and i had to discontinue it due to a 12h period of constant panic and chest tremors after taking a dose. 

As a result, I was prescribed Breo when I didn't seem to stay persistently non-inflamed and my asthma became uncontrolled. Breo worked fine, but about 3 weeks in I got pretty on edge, showed some palpitations, and was having a lot of tremors. Thus, I was given a script for Flovent 3 days ago. Unfortunately, it feels like Flovent isn't helping much, as I'm using my rescue inhaler once daily anyway, and I know SABA meds are worse long-term than LABA meds. I was thinking of just skipping tonight's Flovent dose and going back to Breo in the morning, since overall my condition was way better on Breo, and the side effects, though not great, were manageable .  I'm a little afraid that I'm making a rash decision, since I think I might be coming down with some sort of infection that could be interfering, and I'm wondering if I might also just be reacting poorly to coming off of a daily laba. Has anyone had similar experiences? I would love to hear your thoughts.  


As a side note, has anyone else developed a chest rash occasionally after taking Breo or Flovent?

94,"Hello guys. TLDR at the bottom.

As you can see in the title already I think my problem stems from allergies. I have to deal with dust mite allergy since I am a kid, 6yrs or so, and also deal with ""hey fever"" and shortness of breath since that time around. Docs did a test about pollen but it came out negative back then and except for dust mites the problems were sort of dismissed, especially by my mom bc for whatever reason she thought keeping pets was a good idea for me and basically forced them on me and my sister.

Now, or more like this summer, I was in hospital due to nuts so I've had another test this year.
Unsirprisingly pollen and grasses came out positive this time. And of course also animal hair.

So I began taking cetirizine. I take one almost every day and I noticed that my breathing improved.
I told this my to my doc, he asked if the cetirizine helps, I confirmed.

So he ordered a spirometry test, told I should stop taking the pill the day before.

Now I had this test on friday. Unfortunately I drank a cup of coffee, because I thought it is a good idea.
I have noticed that my breathing improved when I drank coffee or tea, which was the main reason I became a tea drinker in the first place. So I figured yesterday to look up the effects of coffee on Asthma. Of course I found out it actually does help a lot of people, or at least those were the claims I read and based on what I experienced it makes sense to me.

Additionally in winter time I have also noticed way to often that I couldn't get any air anymore. Still dismissed it until the last couple weeks.

Also I've also received a comment on that situation from my Dad too. We were riding the bicycle together, I was out of breath pretty quick.
He is a smomer of 20+ years and told me I am in my 20s, that shouldn't be the case. I was like, yeah I guess.

So I called my docs office today, asked the receptionist whether he has seen the result or not. She told me yeah, didn't say anything about it so it's all alright.

Now my question(s).

Could ot be Psychosomatic? Was it a dumb idea drinking the coffee that day bc it may have interfered?
Also does anybody here suffer from allergic Asthma and could give a bit of advice? Because even though my breathing has improved it is far from healed, although I feel better..

Thanks in advance

I want to share my experience because I know how nerve-rattling it is worrying about covid while you have asthma. 

Background : 19m, workout 5 days a week (run, lift, hiit), not the best diet. Very mild asthma. I grew up taking Advair once a day and had asthma problems 3-4 times a year. I was hospitalized multiple times as a child from asthma complications. I weened myself off of Advair by time I got to high school. Now I have mild asthma problems maybe once a year. 

Day 1 : Woke up with a runny nose and slight sinus congestion. As the day went on, the congestion got worse. Pulse ox reads 100

Day 2 : Woke up with burning sinuses along with the same symptoms from day 1. By nighttime I noticed my sense of smell was weak. Pulse ox reads 99

Day 3 : Barely slept the night before from the bad congestion and headaches. Sinus pressure so intense my eye was watering and swollen. Developed a slight sore throat and went in to get tested. Blew my nose all day and I couldn’t taste tuna. Felt like my sinuses were being sandblasted. Pulse ox reads 99

Day 4 : Test result came back positive. Headache, sinus congestion, and slight fatigue at night. Taste and smell still gone. Pulse ox reads 98-99

Day 5 : Congestion magically disappeared and the only symptom I had was no smell/taste. I felt slightly weak until I drank some water. Pulse ox reads 98

Day 6 : Smell and taste starting to return, and I noticed slight aches in my lungs/back after vacuuming my room. They were gone in about 15 minutes. Pulse ox reads 100

Day 7 : feel 99% normal, I’m just slightly low on energy, like my body is tired. Pulse ox reads 99

Day 8 : Normal. Pulse ox reads 99

Day 9 (today): Normal. Pulse ox reads 100. Smell is back 70%.

18,"I had asthma since I was 2. I am 20 now. I used ventolin and flixotide during most my childhood, occasionally I was put on the purple inhaler too. I had pneumonia 3 times as child. During last 5 or so years I didn't need flixotide anymore, and my doctor just gave me ventolin to use whenever I feel like I get an attack. For last 2 and a half years I had no symptoms of asthma, and no attacks at all. A few months ago I moved, and I forgot or lost my Ventolin in the process but as I had no symptoms for so long I thought I won't need it ever again. Yesterday night I got chest pains. Then I couldn't breathe. I couldn't sleep at all and I had to go to doctor during the night to be put on nebulizer for 2 doses of ventolin. 
Yesterday was one of the worst attacks I had since I can remember. What I'm trying to say is guys even if you think it's all gone, it's not. It might come back when you least expect it.

31,"I'm looking for advice and objective perspectives. I live in the Pacific Northwest and and dealing with the massive amounts of smoke in the valley right now. I have severe asthma. I'm on a twice daily maintainence medication, singular, own a nebulizer that I've used 2-4 times a day since the smoke came into my city, have an air filter in my moderately sealed apartment, and was prescribed prednisone on Tuesday by my doctor. I was an idiot and went to work Wednesday and Thursday, thinking that the prednisone and albuterol would keep the asthma at bay despite my workplace not being very well sealed from the smoke. I was wrong apparently.

Despite being on prednisone for 2 days, and liberally using my nebulizer, I can't keep my asthma under control. Anytime I stand up and move around I'm hyperventilating. Is it because I went out into the smoky air? Would it get better if I just stay inside and call out at work until the air quality is better? Or now that my asthma is aggravated despite my meds, I should go to the ER to get it under control?

One of my biggest issues is that prednisone jacks up my heart rate which makes my anxiety even worse, and I have a hard time separating what is a reasonable fear and what is not.

I see so many posts about ""go to the ER now!"" and ""Asthma can kill you!"". If that's the case, why do the ER doctors always seem so calm about my asthma?

I've gone to the ER 3 times in my life for asthma attacks, and they always give me a nebulizer treatment, steroids, and say something like ""well it sounds like you're moving air well"" when they listen to my lungs. Very non-chalant, like you silly young man, you should have waited for Monday and seen your PCP for this. 

Now, I'm on steroids and have a nebulizer. Is there anything else they would do for me at the ER? Or would I be wasting a disgusting amount of money for them to look at me like an idiot and just give me a nebulizer treatment? (which I could do at home!)

First time poster from NZ here.

Just wondering what peoples thoughts are on Symbicort? 

I've recently been prescribed this new turbuhaler to replace the Flixotide and Ventolin I was taking, as the NZ Ministry of Health is pushing people to adopt the ""two in one"" devices to make it easier to remember to take the preventative especially, while also having access to the reliever.

I had an asthma attack at home a week ago and the Symbicort did nothing at all to prevent or relieve this. After 30mins of suffering with breathing difficulties and a heckin cough and wheeze, I decided to puff on the Ventolin reliever and the attack subsided in minutes.

My GP has since reversed the switch and kept me on the two separate inhalers, while also commenting this was not the first time they'd heard of it not working.

I just got out of my Asthma doctors office and he was very short and to the point. I don’t know if he was worried I would give it to him or something but he was treating me like I was still deathly ill and treating me using my rescue once a day (if that) to being very bad. 

This is my third  appointment with him and after the last one I have been monitoring my peak flow daily and he barley looked at them and said I have to find out what my averages are (idk how to do that honestly) and now to take them three times a week “my numbers look good”. 

Originally he said I had mild asthma but on my form I received it says “Asthma, intermittent: long term course worsening” does this mean that I’m going to continue to get worse? He didn’t explain what that means or even that it was there. I’m currently going to get a chest X-ray to make sure there aren’t anymore complications (I was told I had a questionable pneumonia about a week ago from another X-ray and have been on moxicillin as well as a five day Z pack to try and knock it out of me.)


But I wait... it gets crazier:

He said that Moxicillin doesn’t treat your lungs? Did it even help my pneumonia then? He is giving me more antibiotics and told me to stop the moxicillin 

New meds:
 Doxycycline 100mg 1 pill twice daily for 10 days
(More steroids after I was originally given a hefty amount of 20 mg steroids, and then was given a taper to taper off of them) he wanted me on more: prednisone 10 mg one tablet twice daily for 5 days.. 

Then he told me that I should stay out of work because Covid tends to COME BACK?!? And reinfects you.. like I thought I was beginning to be in the clear and now I’m both worried about that, the new meds being too much, and my asthma worsening..

Can anyone help me understand if any of this is a little suspect or if I’m truly not out of the woods yet.. are there any asthma specialist in this Thread?

Some background: I’ve had asthma for 2 decades. It started out allergy induced and turned into a chronic thing when I made the fun decision to start smoking as a teenager - I quit 7 years ago but the asthma stuck, yay me. 

For as long as I remember, when I have asthma attacks or even just a coughing fit, I get extremely itchy on my stomach. Not my whole stomach but more specifically JUST the right side just below my rib cage. I suppose this would be in the liver region? I would also get itchy across my entire lower chest region (think upper boobs, sorry lol).

It isn’t a typical itch where the skin is itchy, but it feels like my insides are itchy. Like there’s little bugs crawling on the underside of my skin. I can itch and itch and itch and this only makes it worse. The only thing that relieves the itch is super heavy breathing. That seems the help with the itching in my chest but my stomach itch just kind of goes away on it’s own.

Describing it in detail is almost giving me the same sensation so maybe it’s psychological lol.

Asthma treatments aren’t really working, and I am confused and looking for insight while I wait months for another appointment with a Covid-busy pulmonologist...

I am a 6’3 overweight giant male, 40, former moderate smoker and current cpap user. I’ve been cleared by a cardio, and chest X-ray and CTs are otherwise fine (no scarring, spots, or wheezes etc).  They ran a huge bloodwork panel so it’s not a clot or a mold allergy or anemia or a number of other low hanging fruit, I am relatively healthy otherwise except for the weight and some minor normal over-the-hill bullshit. My SpO2 is always above 96 even when walking around and I rock the socks off my flow meter.

I have been treated with.... Pulmicort, Breo Ellipta, Singulair, and Spiriva long term inhalers; various varieties of Albuterol rescue inhalers; many courses of prednisone or medrol (so many that elevated blood sugar put me in the ER); and cetirizine and montelukast. 

Nothing is helping with any consistency, and now I am on straight budesonide nebulizer and albuterol nebulizer multiple times per day with optional 50mg prednisone pill. I feel like a hospital patient.

It is highly variable - I might feel normal for a whole day, and then can’t catch a breath to save my life in the evening, my chest hurting like hell from trying so hard to pull in as much air as possible (which is why my lungs are enlarged). Sometimes it’s fine in the middle of the night, sandwiched between a terrible evening and morning.

68,"Pre-story:
Hello! My name is Shawn and I am 19. I have had pretty severe asthma for the last 5 years. I was originally diagnosed when I was age 7-9 I think. It went away for a few years then came back pretty hard. I over the last few years with my asthma progressively getting worse I have found it hard to keep up with my medicines. I would find myself out and about without my daily preventive inhaler and I wouldn’t feel good or I would have problems and I would then have to go home. I ended up buying a medicine bag that straps to my waist and is under my shirt and it keeps my medicines on me everywhere I go. But I still would find myself not taking my medicine in time and I would start to feel very bad. You know how it goes. So I have been looking for a good app that reminds me when to take my medicines before it’s too late. I have had problems finding one. I settled for an app called “Round” I have used it for the last year. My only problem is that I can only set alarms for the same time every day. Rather then X amount of time after I take a medicine. 

My mission:
So I have been learning to program recently and I invested in a Mac and decided to make my own app. I want to make an app for people like us who need help keeping track of our medicines things will easy to personalize. Like setting alarms for certain times of the day or every so many hours. It will keep track of how many doses you have left in your inhalers too. I have so many more features I will need to add. But all I know is what features I want or need. Can I have you guys comment if you would use the app, what features would be important to you, so that I can add them to my to do list? 

This will not be a quick process. It will take me a lot of time to develop. But this has been something I have been wanting to do for a long time and I finally can start. It probably won’t be a free app, probably just $0.99 to help cover the $99 yearly fee for having it listed on the App Store.

69,"My fiance was diagnosed with asthma a few of days ago after a week of one 2hour attacks a day for the past week after spending time with my dog. He hasn't had an attack for about 5 days now and before this has maybe had less than a handful of attacks in his life. He was given an inhaler to use but I'm worried he's over using it. He uses it every time he gets even the slightest bit breathless. Like if he's run up the stairs or done something physical after not doing much all day. Before this would make him breathless because exercise does that, he'd catch his breathe for a second and then be fine. But now any sign of breathlessness even for normal reasons and reasons we know dont cause attacks he uses it and thinks its an attack.
I dont know if this happens with some people and its just because he's new to all it and he might just chill after a while or if its something I should mention? I'm worried he's going to do himself some damage by over using it or become dependent on it because he'll start associating anytime he's breathless with needing to use it. He's a groundsworker and generally very fit and healthy and exercise doesn't set off his asthma.

I'm feeling down about my recent asthma diagnosis. This may be partially asking for relationship advice, my spouse is convinced that it isn't our two cats that is causing my asthma, it is only an allergen from outside (we moved to the east coast last year, and my asthma started at lockdown). She doesn't understand the science behind it, and she is just terrified by the prospect of getting rid of the cats. I haven't even brought that up as an option, but she is worried that is what will happen. She gave me a lot of pushback in just getting the cats out of our room. They are out now, I am getting out of the house every day that I can by going to the library to study, and I got an air filter for the house. How long should I give these changes we made time to work? And it's gonna be a fight to get rid of the cats if it comes to that, and I would prefer to keep them if possible.

72,"Hi fellow asthmatics! I used Advair for about 12 years, and now Symbicort for 5. About two months ago, I was diagnosed with central serous chorioretinopathy, which is a dark spot in the central vision, usually in one eye, usually in males 30-50. The two main causes are stress (definitely had a lot of that during COVID times) and inhaled glucocorticoids, of which symbicort is one.

I've managed to reduce the stress in my life quite a bit, and reduced my symbicort dosage by 25% (from 400 per day to 300.) However, two weeks ago the vision disturbance got worse.

My ophthalmologist recommends switching to a non-steroid inhaler, so I am switching to Atrovent. 

My questions: anybody ever have any vision side effects from Symbicort, and also, anybody make the switch from Symbicort to Atrovent? or similar switch to an anticholinergic inhaler? What is the difference, experience wise?

I had asthma as a child and outgrew it I didn't really have any problems until lately. About 2 months ago my mum used a diffuser and my chest felt tight the next day I had trouble breathing  and developed a non productive cough. I thsn went to dr and started on symbicort twice a day and salbutmol when i need it. I've been on these  meds for about 5 weeks and haven't seen much improvement with  my cough. It is dry and comes and goes, i feel tight chested then the cough starts i dont cough up anything but feels like there is something there. I then get lots of mucus that I need to swallow and chest is sore from coughing for a day or two after. It happens every few days I found my triggers to be diffusers and candles and cleaning products. I don't really get a wheezing. I've had a chest x ray which was normal and had a lung function which was 84% with no ventolin and 93% with ventolin so my Dr said  it was close enough to be asthma and continue taking the symbicort. Does this sound like asthma? My DR seems to be  bit clueless. I am just worried about this lingering dry cough and surely the steroids would have made a difference by now if it was asthma? Will the cough always be there if it is asthma?

77,"I’m so glad I found this sub! I’ve been reading so many posts today. I have been suffering for months.

Me: 38 F. Twins 2 years ago, healthy pregnancy, no other health issues, no previous meds. 

Breathing test clear. Allergy test also clear.

Symptoms: my lungs hurt, squeezing and pressure in my lungs, feeling as if there is a brick in there. Extra production of phlegm, constantly force a cough to clear lungs. Taking a deep breath is uncomfortable.

I had an umbilical hernia repair in March 2020 - 1 month later I began to have issues breathing. I went to the hospital and was admitted for 5 days as they ran tests and gave me meds. They couldn’t find anything wrong so diagnosed it as Asthma. 

I’ve never had allergies or asthma in my life. I was given Albuteral, Advair and prednisone. Nothing helped. 

I went to the pulmonologist who then put me on symbicort and singular. Those didn’t help so I went back and begged for a bronchoscopy. I told him I feel like there is an infection infection in my lungs. He agreed to it. Bronchoscopy showed community acquired pneumonia. He put me on cefdenir for 7 days, no relief. I went back and asked for a different antibiotic so he put me on doxycycline for 10 days. A couple of days I almost felt normal but then back to the same. 

He’s at a loss of why I have these symptoms. He then mentioned my vocal cords were slightly parted and referred me to an ENT to have surgery to close them. I want to get my lung issue under control before I do that. 

I’m miserable, since these symptoms started, I haven’t had a single day where I could breath normal. I’ve been tempted to go back to the ER several times but have held off. I’ve also reached out to the Mayo Clinic for an appt. I’m desperate, even though that would be very expensive to travel out there. 

My husband has asthma that’s under control and he said he never has the symptoms I have. He said when it flairs, he wheezes and has a hard time getting air but a rescue inhaler works immediately. For me, my symptoms are constant no matter what. I can run 2-3 miles on the treadmill and that doesn’t affect them. I don’t wheeze like I’m gasping for air. Just massive pressure in my chest and lungs. 

I’m also thinking of going to another pulmonologist for a second opinion. Curious on others experience and if a second opinion first would be the best choice before traveling to the Mayo Clinic. I can’t live like this, I’m depressed, can’t sleep, no energy, and it causes extreme anxiety. I just want answers.",Asthma,My story - still searching for relief,1599586406
78,"I just wanted to share my experience with my fellow asthmatics. Here’s a timeline to keep things brief:

Week of August 24th:
It started gradually, with both my boyfriend and I experiencing sinus congestion and post nasal drip. We were both also sweating heavily at night. He peaked one night that week, probably around Wednesday, and slept all day. He ran a mild fever that evening, around 100, and vomited once. I also ran a low-grade fever, around 99.6. But within a couple of hours of taking Tylenol, both our fevers were gone. The next day, we both felt better.

Week of August 31st: 
We continued to experience some sinus congestion but overall felt much improved. I overdid myself by cleaning and taking my dog for several long jogs, which is why I believe aim worsened. My boyfriend continued to improve and now has no symptoms.

Friday, September 4th:
The sinus congestion got must worse, and the post nasal drip started to irritate my lungs and flare my asthma. Oxygen remained good. I just thought it was allergies.

Saturday, September 5th:
I woke up drowning in post-nasal drip, and my lungs were extremely itchy and tight. I had a sore throat. I was coughing up phlegm, but my cough wasn’t deep. No fever, oxygen continued to stay solid. I went to urgent care this day and was tested. I was told my lungs sounded “weezy” and was put on prednisone and z-pac antibiotics. I also started taking DayQuil, Zyrtec D, my steroid inhaler and started using my nebulizer every 4 hours or so. I am also using my CPAP at night which seems to help.

Sunday, September 6th:
My sinuses were cleared to the point they were raw feeling by the next day, and my lungs weren’t as tight. I thought I was much improved, but mid-day I started to have cold sweats and my temperature was between 99.0 and 99.4 for several hours. Eventually it passed, and I haven’t experienced the cold sweats or a temperature like that since.

Monday, September 7th:
I continued to feel a tiny bit better and only used my nebulizer twice that day. I switched from DayQuil to Corticidin because I have high blood pressure/a pre-existing heart condition, and that seems to help. I have to take it every 4 hours on the dot, though, the same with Zyrtec D, which I’m taking every 12 hours, or the drainage comes back and starts irritating my lungs. I don’t cough often, and usually when I do it’s light, breaking up some phlegm, or it’s dry, but sometimes it does hurt like having bronchitis.

Today, Tuesday September 8th:
I slept really well last night, using my CPAP. I only had to wake up once or twice to redo my medications, and my lungs mostly feel “itchy” today. I have some very mild chest pain, more like soreness, radiating from my lungs that comes and goes depending on if I’ve been coughing or not. I can breathe in deeply, but it irritates my lungs to do so too often. I continue to have a perfect blood oxygen and my temperature is more like 97.8 now. I can move around the house but I do feel “weak”. Not breathless per say, because even moving around my oxygen remains around 98.

84,"People don’t like having their axioms swept from under them, so I understand the irrational anger that people confront truth with sometimes.  Read this and answer my questions at the end.  I hope we can all have a constructive, civil discussion in the comments, that moves us all towards truth.

Hyperventilation has its roots in the soft, western, post-industrial diet.  The diet is low volume, high calorie.  Humans are not designed to eat 1000 calories in a sitting.  This puts great stress on the metabolism, and therefore on respiration.  Post consumption, respiratory rate increases dramatically.  This can lead to mouth breathing.  Especially during exercise.  When you mouth breathe, the tongue drops from the palette, and no longer supports the correct foreword growth of the maxilla (upper jaw bone).  Our jaws work about 5% as hard as our ancestors jaws.  This is a classic case of if you don’t lose it you lose it.  Our mouths are shrinking rapidly as our jaws sink back into our airway/gullet.  The airway becomes significantly smaller, teeth become crooked, and you become less attractive.

On to how hyperventilation causes asthma.  Asthma is not in our DNA.  Perhaps, due to generational consumption of soft foods, there could be epigenetic predispositions at most.  ‘Asthma’ is a natural response to hypocapnia (low CO2 in the blood), that can be stimulated in any human or mammal.  Bronchospasm reduces airflow, so that you can retain more CO2.  If the CO2 levels in your body fall past and certain point, you will die.  This is a life saving reaction, and it should not be tampered with.  If you introduce a bronchodilator when you have bronchospasm, there is no defence against losing CO2.  So your levels drop further.  This is what produces the standard side effects associated with rescue inhalers.  It’s clear that overtime, use of bronchodilators causes nasal blockage.  This is your body’s secondary defence against hyperventilation.  This of course, leads to mouth breathing, and facial lengthening, etc.

Nose breathing.  Given we now know the roots of bronchospasm, it is clear why nose breathing is the correct form of breathing.  The nose is the human breathing organ.  Ever seen a cross section of a human head?  The nasal cavity takes up more of your head than your mouth and upper throat.  The mouth has no adaptations for breathing, whilst the nose has innumerable adaptations.  Humidifying, filtering, etc.  Another obvious advantage to nasal breathing is the reduction in airflow.  This will of course increase your CO2 levels.  CO2 is a bronchodilator.  Your airways be more open than they are when you breathe through your mouth.  You will have less need for the mucus lining your lungs, so some of that will come up.  The mucus’ purpose is, again, to reduce the loss of CO2 from your alveoli.  Anyway, I could go on forever.  Here are some interesting questions for you to try.

These could be tied together as one question, but anyway:

1. Where is asthma in ancient, hunter-gathering humans?  And why are their mid/lower faces perfectly formed?  Why do 99.5% of skulls found have perfectly straight teeth?

2. Why do none of our cousins in our ape family suffer from this problem?

Hello all,

I am a rising junior in High School. I am currently participating in the Science Research program and I am conducting a study that needs participants. My study is testing if the adherence to daily asthma medication is different when not using a reminder each time the medication is supposed to be taken compared to using a reminder. This study will be done over the period of 2 weeks, however, it should only take up 15-20 minutes of your time from answering 2 questionnaires, one prior to the beginning and one after the study period. This study is aimed towards children, more specifically 12-17 year olds because studies have shown that this is the most vulnerable group in regards to low adherence rates with daily asthma medication. If you would like your child to participate, they must be between 12-17 years of age, have been taking a daily inhaler for asthma for the past 2 weeks and will continue to use it for the next two weeks, and are currently not using any sort of reminder to help them remember to take their medication. I strongly encourage you to let your child participate in this study. This study will not only help researchers such as myself gather more information about adherence to daily medication, your child may find a method that will help them remember their medication, making them healthier. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me at [thetaraz27@gmail.com](mailto:thetaraz27@gmail.com)

22,"I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 6 years old. I don’t remember the specifics but I remember staying in hospital for a while because of it. I came out and immediately had to start using a reliever and a preventer inhaler. 

For a while it did work. I was active, and took part in a lot of sports up until the age of 10. Then I felt myself getting out of breath more. I couldn’t do simple exercises like jogging without getting out of breath. But I was too scared to tell anyone because at that point I was being bullied by the kids at school for not being able to do simple jogs. The nurse I went to see regularly was also not very understanding and would shout at me to use my preventer even though I was following everything that I was told to do. She didn’t believe me when I said I felt like the current inhalers weren’t working. 

So for the next 8 years, I became extremely unfit and my asthma got worse. Going up the stairs was a struggle for me. I was so embarrassed that I couldn’t tell anyone about it. 

But last year I was at my worst. I was down with the cold and got an asthma attack just by turning to the other side in bed. I went to the GP and spoke to them. I was so scared they’d tell me that I was overreacting. But they listened to me and made me feel so comfortable. They changed my medication and now I feel so much better. 

I’ve started working out again and i can finally get through half an hour without having to take long breaks. I still have a long road ahead as I’m not very fit but I’m excited to see the progress. 

I’m sorry for the rant, I just don’t have anyone to tell. But the one thing i regret the most is neglecting my health for so long. Being able to breath properly now is like a dream come true.

23,"I just got my first allergy test done, and it came back positive for every single thing they tested me for :(. 

I’ve had asthma my entire life, and the worst asthma attacks I’ve ever had are from long exposure to cats. Of course cats came up as one of the worst reactions on the test. 

However, the reason I’m writing this post is to ask if any of you feel like you have allergies to things like dogs and pollen that just make you itchy and sneeze, and then allergies to other things that make you feel asthmatic? 

About 90% of the time I have “allergies” I’m sneezing and itchy, I never feel asthmatic. But there’s a few things, like cats, that will give me more asthmatic symptoms on top of itchiness. 

A big reason why I got the test was because I was having chest tightness randomly throughout the day at home. Our landlord neglected a mold issue, we got the spores tested, and I have now learned I’m allergic to that mold. At that home (we’ve now moved) I never had the itchy symptoms, just chest tightness. Now that we’ve moved it’s been a lot better too, but I’ve also recently been put on symbicort and montelukast to help with these symptoms, so idk if the relief is from the medication or the move. The mold did come back positive but it was as high of a reaction as cats and grass.

On Breo I lived like a normal person without asthma, I could travel, sleep at other people’s houses, never remember to bring my inhaler w me, it was AMAZING!!! Then, I developed adrenal insufficiency, had to quit my job due to having no fucking cortisol, got severe gastritis which triggered a sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and it fucking sucked. I am now on Alvesco with a spacer and formoterol. I still have gastritis and am having some trouble adjusting the Alvesco dose to stop all my attacks. I’m an ICU nurse, my sister is a pharmacist and my mom is a nurse, so I have wonderful resources. I have always been on top of my asthma, never needing to be intubated, maybe 2 prednisone tapers in the last 15 years, very well controlled w meds.

My issue is, I don’t want to take steroids anymore. I can’t heal my gastritis - I’ve done all the things, carafate, ppi, histamine blockers, acid watcher diet, gastritis diet, everything. From reading real research articles gastritis is a side effect of steroids, all different kinds including inhaled.

Also, formoterol is $1000 w my insurance a month. And I can’t do that. I’m looking into other options, dr appt in 8 days.

Basically I am feeling like I don’t know what to do. I have allergies to all grass, trees, nuts, animals, dust, and high/severe IgE levels to ALL fucking foods except dairy, eggs, and most meats. 

My questions for y’all are:
Should I try an elimination diet/paleo? I just don’t know where to start, I’m already so limited, w gastritis and all my high IgE levels w foods.

Should I do allergy shots again? Had the 3 times in my life, I’m 35.

Should I see a chiropractor? Saw one as a kid, has a huge massive improvement in asthma, but my mom isn’t sure if it was chiro or me cutting all food preservatives, food coloring and artificial flavors (triggers of mine)

Should I see an acupuncturist? Going to the dark side here- I dunno feeling like there is no hope with what I’m currently doing.

I found some studies done w FDA for a specific combination of traditional Chinese medicine called ASHMI that worked as well as prednisone in clinical trials and didnt fuck w the HPA axis/adrenals.

I don’t have asthma, and during most of Elementary there was a BUNCH of kids pretending to have asthma. Moving to middle school I was relieved there wasn’t a high amount  of kids doing this, so I was relieved.

This is where I met my friend. Let’s call her Anna.
So when I first went to class, I remember she was always really quiet. So one day I decided to talk to her during Lunch. 
We actually became really good friends that same day, and she told me that she had asthma and then she showed me her inhaler. I was surprised she wasn’t lying, and then she proceeded to tell me some stuff about her asthma problems. We finished lunch and we went back to class. I was a little confused tho because she was really shy towards most people.
Fast forward to around 2 months later. We are all assigned a PowerPoint that we are supposed to make and then present in front of the class.
When the day of presenting our PowerPoints came, me and Anna we’re ready to present.
Around 6 kids presented when It was Anna’s turn. Anna goes up and starts presenting. Around halfway during her presentation, Me and my other friends noticed she was having trouble speaking, and It started to become clearer that she was having an asthma attack. She didn’t signal or anything she just kept presenting. At this point I was going around her backpack looking for he inhaler.

52,"Hey guys. So my asthma is pretty well controlled. I don't suffer from attacks commonly at all BUT I do take my asthma rescue inhaler before going to exercise. I don't think I can do much exercise without it (I haven't tried in a while) but if I do like a 15 minute intense HIIT exercise or something without taking my inhaler, I will start wheezing. However, other than that,  I don't use my inhaler/get attacks/ etc. unless I am exposed to a lot of pollution. I don't think it affects my daily life much at all other than the exercise bit.

55,"I know this is a vague title. But I am feeling incredibly discouraged at the moment, here. So, just to give a bit of my story:

Just a few years ago, I had no problems getting out there and running 7+ miles no problem, intervals, and just in general exercising to my heart’s content. Around spring of 2018 after moving from the US Northeast to the US Southeast, my lung function and ability to run started going downhill pretty drastically and I found myself wheezing after just a few minutes of running, waking up in the middle of the night feeling like I was about to cough my heart art, being congested all the damn time, and just being pretty miserable in general. I got a PFT and was diagnosed with asthma, pretty reactive airways the doctor said. My doctor prescribed me Advair, Albuterol, Montelukast, Singulair, and Fluticasone to deal with all of these issues. I did not notice any real improvements with these medications. 

I then moved to the US Northwest, where things got a bit better actually! My congestion let up, I was able to breathe better, etc. I was slowly re-building my running ability, and I was able to run even up to 8 miles on a good day. I still could not do intervals to the level I had a couple of years ago (breathing was still pretty difficult) but it was better than in the Southeast. 

Earlier this year, I moved to San Diego, CA. And about a month into that, I just started getting this constant chest tightness. Worse than I’d had even in the Southeast. Not a whole lot of wheezing, just tightness. All the time, no matter what time of the day. Exercising became miserable once again. I got my IgE levels and allergies tested, and IgE came out around 501, which isn’t even that high apparently. Also I am allergic to everything in this state lol. My pulm prescribed me Qvar and Spiriva. And the first week or so, the tightness let up a bit... and then came back. I don’t feel as if either of those two inhalers are helping, and I just hate the feeling after inhaling whatever it is that’s in them - I feel lightheaded and a bit dizzy. I talked with my allergist and he agreed to have me try Xolair. I got my first injection last Thursday, and the weekend and up until today things have been just miserable. I know Xolair is more of a long term sort of thing, and the results can take some time to see, but nonetheless: chest tightness and inability to exercise like I used to are still a thing. 

All of this has had an incredibly negative impact on my quality of life. I have broken down crying in the gym because it is just so damn hard to *breathe*, even doing non-cardio activities like weights. I wonder if things will ever get better. I just want to be able to run a decent distance again, without feeling like an elephant’s sitting on my chest.

So, for all my asthmatic friends out there who were once able to run and exercise to their heart’s content but asthma ruined that for them: once you got your asthma under control, did things go back to “normal”? Were you able to do the things you did before? Did it get better?

I appreciate anyone who has read this far. I’m seriously at my wits end here, and would love to hear of any success stories out there!

With scientists and doctors more and more exploring the Bradykinin Theory for Covid (Google it), there could be some tie-in with Montelukast (MK) and it’s ability to stop a bradykinin storm response. It appears from this article that researchers are already looking into it. It might explain the unexpectedly low number of asthmatics presenting with severe Covid if many (like me) take it daily. 

At any rate, if you’re on MK, now might be a good time to refill before they discover something and a rush happens. It would be wonderful though if it proved helpful.

Symptoms off/on since fall 2016
Chest/lungs?


I’m curious if anyone has a clue about it these weird symptoms I’ve been dealing with for some years. It seems off and on I will get these days, sometimes several in a row of this heavy pressure feeling in chest and like as if my lungs are full of concrete or simply so inflamed it’s almost like they feel hard. I know this probably sounds weird. Typically with this there is also some mild SOB symptoms. 

It’s hard to tell if this is just a more severe anxiety than I normally experience.. I have GAD and panic attacks and experience the sob often with that.. but this always feels different. In the past I have tried ibuprofen, tussin chest congestion, Zyrtec and Claritin with little relief. I have sometimes felt the tussin maybe opened things up a bit.

I always wonder if I have asthma as it really feels like my lungs just are inflamed or as if the airways are narrow when this happens. Sometimes I think it’s allergies but I show no other symptoms like sneezing, watery eyes, or stuffy nose. I have noticed that if I’m sweeping up lots of dust or dog hair that can send me into a sneezing rage and clear out all this mucous I didn’t even think I had in me. So sometimes I wonder if it’s just built up and I need to do something to trigger the mucous to expel itself and maybe then it would relieve some pressure. I’ve never been able to figure this out.

I tend to realize after a night of drinking this pressure may show up more often than on a regular day but not always. I have experienced the worst of these symptoms after a night of hard drugs in the past. I had this kind of chest pressure, congestion, feeling I could hardly get breaths out so bad I felt like I would die all day long the day after. I haven’t done any hard drugs in about two years. I didn’t do them very commonly before either. I don’t smoke cigarettes although I have before in my life, but never bought packs or was a true smoker. I have spent a lot of time around others that smoke in the last 8 years though. Not constantly but exposure is there. I don’t smoke weed although I have but again not much. 

Sometimes I’ve even wondered if this could be heart related. Usually I assume that’s just my anxiety kicking in but sometimes when the pressure is so much it just ruins my whole day. It makes everything miserable. I just feel like I have emphysema or something. It’s like this feeling of just total fullness and sickness in my chest. I truly believe this isn’t anxiety related although it sparks my anxiety. Typically I get some sob with anxiety and I have had chest pains with it a long time ago but not really anymore. I can sleep and be totally restful but wake up with that feeling and know that when I get up and walk around it won’t dissipate but will just be weighing heavy on my chest all day making me feel like I’m breathing through a straw.

I’m obviously thinking about it too much right now. It’s just something I’ve had off and on and when it’s on and it’s bad it’s really bad and I feel that I must truly have something fucked up I don’t know about in my chest. I really wouldn’t be surprised at all if it was allergy or asthma related. I need to push to have some tests done at least for peace of mind, but also because after years of dealing with it I really think there could be at least something minor that is triggering this. 

I never had any of these issues when I was growing up. I moved to southern Illinois from up near Chicago area and have had it start a few years after being here. I have no idea if it’s pollens, if it’s because I have a giant fluffy dog (4yrs) and it’s just a buildup of his hair!!, if it’s literally asthma cuz I’ve gotten more out of shape as I got older, if it’s some wild manifestation of anxiety that feels so debilitatingly physical, or something else! 

Running for more than a few minutes in a row even after weeks of doing it, I still can’t do longer and I tend to lose my breath completely or start wheezing toward end and take an hour to fully recover. I notice if I dance around or try to sing I can lose my breath and feel like my airways are restricted too. Even if I talk super fast for several minutes I’ll occasionally get breathlessness and feel like everything gets inflamed in my lungs and throat.

Does anyone have an opinion on what the hell this is? It’s so hard for me to believe I feel like this a lot after years of having no issues at all. I feel crazy not having an actual answer. It makes me feel like I’m old and have been a smoker my entire life. I just don’t get it. Some days I don’t really have any of this. But usually there is some mild symptoms here and there especially like now! I have noticed heat and humidity really triggers not the chest pressure feeling but the SOB breathing.

I had a second round of tests with my new doctor (pulmonologist) a couple months back. I honestly can’t remember if I withheld those meds that time, but I definitely don’t remember him giving me instructions either way... I have a feeling I withheld the meds because that’s what I was told to do the first time, but I can’t remember and it’s totally possible that I forgot to do that.

I’m having my third round of tests next week, and I’m not sure what to do. I can of course call my pulm if need be, but I’m feeling a bit self conscious about being a pain because I’ve had a lot of issues with my breathing this week which required more than one phone call. I figured I’d check in here with you seasoned PFT-taking pros to see if this is a simple yes or no before I bug my pulm again.

93,"Ok a couple months after quarantine started I started to breathe harder. I honestly didn’t think much of it, but my parents were concerned I think this was around may ish. So they gave my albuterol and buedisonied and it went away. But then in June it happened again and my parents said it was because I wasn’t exercising ( I wasn’t I had sat on my bum all day for the last couple months). Anways so after that I start going for regular run and it does help. It goes away and stuff. Although I still feel like my lungs aren’t at level they should be. Before quarantine I used to excersice a lot so maybe I had this before but it just never came up because of it. Ok so I was doing fine honestly until almost 2 months ago I woke up with chest tightness and like a weird feeling of constriction when I breathe. I never had asthma before, but I did have albuterol and buedisonide that my pediatrician prescribed me for when I had the flu and a really bad cough. I took it almost 3 times a day for 2 days and it didn’t go away. So on the 2nd day of taking it I couldn’t sleep at all. I felt really dizzy, and like it felt really weird when I was breathing. Like I was I could breathe fine and my lungs felt open but it just felt like I wasn’t breathing at all. But the next day I took the nebulizer again and my hands were really cold and starting to turn blue. So I called my pediatrician they told me to go to the Er and at the Er they said I was fine. Like they checked my pulse and oxygen and it was all normal. And then they took an X-ray of my lungs to see if any lungs had collapsed and that was fine too. So I was wtf is going on here. My parents were really confused as well. Over the next week I talk to my pediatrician and she tells me to get a covid test. So I do and it comes back negative, and around this time I start taking Ayurvedic medicine. I consult a practitioner and he tells me that I have allergic asthma and a worm issue. I’ve had worms in the past and stuff. My parents have consulted this doctor before and he is very renowned practitioner. So I start taking his medicine and stuff, and it helps a bit. He said I had to take the medicine for my lungs for a year and Ayurvedic medicine is really slow. I’ve taken medicine from him before and it has helped me so yea. My pediatrician told me to continue taking the nebulizer and I did for a couple days but that made feel terrible. Cause my hands were getting cold for no reason and like fingernails would turn purple. They never really turned blue after that one Er visit. I also had like really really mild dizzinesss and like my head would feel tight. So I stopped taking it and started taking the Ayurvedic medicine for a month or so occasionally taking the nebulizer if I needed it and it was getting better but it still didn’t go away. I also somehow got dysphagia as well. When I started taking the nebulizer I felt weird in my throat. Although the day the breathing stuff started I also had a soar throat. So yeah it was also a pain to swallow and I felt that the stomach acid was coming up my throat. So I went to another doctor for my dysphagia and he checked my lungs as well and he said they were clear. I was confused af because I still have this weird feeling of breathing on straws. Anways I went to him a week later as well since he is a lung specialist and he prescribed me Flovent and Albuterol. I dunno why albuterol because I told him it makes me wheeze and feel worse. He also gave me singular which I started taking today. I also told him that my hands would get cold and would turn purple and that he said it was nothing. Ok so it’s been a week and it’s getting better I’m taking the Flovent every day twice along with the Ayurvedic medicine and and i have been getting better. However it’s still not gone. Also my hands do get cold and finger nails turn purple occasionally. My Sp02 is really good. Usually around 98 and 100. But I still feel weird when I breathe. My lungs seem clear. No cough no wheezing. I dunno what’s going on. And I still feel like tight and shit my head. I go for walks and stuff and my parents are struggling to keep up with me so like wtf is this.

95,"I have mcas, plus asthma.  

My mcas presents in flares as cold or flu type symptoms, plus migraines.  Flares can be caused by normal things like pollen, but also by weather phenomena and stress.  So, since 2020 started, I have rarely been out of a flare, it’s been a bad year even without COVID19 stress.  My husband is diabetic, we lost his dad in February, due to fears of Covid19 for both us and his diabetic mom, we’ve not seen her since the funeral.  We are both working remotely, tho I go in two days a week to both get away from the house and give him a break from me, as well as it is just more efficient to be on site.

Anyway, daily I feel like I have a cold, especially in the high histamine mornings.  If it doesn’t improve by lunch, it usually means I am sick or pollen is crazy.  I run fevers without infections, so figuring out if I actually sick is hard.

I have felt seriously ill for just over a week, dizzy, short of breath, easily tired, mild cough, stuffed up ears, nausea and other stomach upset, likely from drainage.  Husband has also felt bad, but he’s not a good barometer for me, he can be a little competitive on who feels the worst.  

I got tested, halfway hoping this was covid and while I felt crappy, if this was the worst, ok, I could handle it.  

Test was negative, no covid.  Just random mcas crap, stress, plus nearby hurricanes.  

So, I am thinking about using my albuterol more often, to combat the shortness of breath.  I feel that I may be so exhausted because I avoid using it unless I feel extreme distress.  Maybe it will help with the congestion and breathing better will help me feel better?

Ive been on a bit of a roller coaster with meds, with Dr office shut downs interrupting treatment. So it's been a long time since I've run. Meds are now built up and I've started running. For the first time in I guess my adult life my lung capacity is not a limiting factor, increasing from 2.5L to 4.5L while on diators.

So I go for a run, having just taken all my meds, including a beta2 agonist and steroid for long term treatment, plus albuterol (another beta2) as prescribed for exercise.

I felt great. No heart palpatations or usual thumping in my throat. No pain in my lungs and I ran a comfortable 30min 5km. I took two garmin with me: 645 Music + Vivo4 for oximeter.

Both recorded the same HR on different arms: 166avg, with a 195 steady average for the last 2km.

97,"A bit of a long backstory, but necessary. I am a lifetime allergy sufferer and received immunotherapy as a child and young adult. In my 30’s I had two sinus surgeries that helped almost eliminate repeat sinus infections with the help of daily allergy medication that I co to use to take. Last year, I started experiencing an unknown allergen (a beauty product of some sort on another person) that was causing an anaphylactic reaction. I was using an epipen a few times a week and scared. I found a new allergist to as mine had retired. The first thing she did was an asthma test which came back negative. I’d never been tested before as I’d  never had issues and rarely ever get a cough. After about a month of monitoring she suspected that  I DID have allergic asthma and prescribed me a rescue inhaler and Dulera. This helped tremendously. I’m no longer around the person that was causing the severe attacks and discontinued the use of the dulera inhaler.  Right now, I’m experiencing some seasonal allergy flare-ups with PND that my meds can’t get under control. Could this be part of the allergic asthma? Could the dulera help? I’m curious if any of my other allergy symptoms are actually asthma. For example, when in I was being exposed to the unknown beauty product allergen  my other symptoms included burning lips and itchy red palms. This was part of the asthma according to the allergist.

15,"After having asthma for over a decade, I finally met with a pulmonologist today and here's everything I learned. 

It's best to take Symbicort in the morning. I was previously only taking 2 puffs at night.  My family doctor suggested I up it to twice in the morning and twice in the evening when my asthma got worse.  The pulmonologist suggested trying twice in the morning, and only once at night if possible.  He said symbicort can cause some nasty side effects while sleeping.

Advil or Aleve are bad for asthma.  I sometimes take them for headaches or backaches.  He said 1-2 times a month is fine, but if you're taking it 3-4 days in a row, it can negatively affect your asthma.  He said Tylenol is best.

I have bad nocturnal asthma, and he highly recommends I stop eating 3-4 hours before laying down for bed.  Also, try to limit caffeine, or at least stop it around 4 hours before bed.

He also highly recommends air purifiers.  Each room I went into in the doctor's office had air purifiers. 

I recently started taking Singulair and brought up the fear of side effects (mental health), since I have dealt with anxiety in the past.  I've been on it for almost an entire month now.  He said if I was going to exhibit any of those symptoms, they would have come up already.  

He said if I'm having a bad day, I can take Symbicort (200/6) a maximum of 8 times during a day.  If I max out, and my breathing is still bad, I need to go to the emergency.

For the women out there, please be sure to speak to your doctors if you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant.  He said some of my drugs would have to be changed if I was going to be pregnant.",Asthma,Met with a Pulmonologist and here's what I learned,1598557521
16,"Tomorrow I will finish my second week of pulmonary rehab. Normally a normal course would be 12 weeks, due to COVID it is now 6 weeks. It is basically working out under the guidance of physical therapists. They regularly measure your saturation and heartbeat and adjust your workout to it. They keep your work out just above your maximum effort. 

My group contains 3 people (including me) and two physical therapists. So it almost feels like a personal training session. It lasts one hour in which during the work out they explain all kinds of stuff about how to breathe, how your body works etc. 

Frequency is three times a week, starting at 08.30 h. 

I have late-onset allergic asthma along with other allergies. The reason I was signed on for rehab is that I was hospitalized in December 2019. Before I was even starting rehab I was again hospitalized in February 2020. Then COVID happened so my rehab was pushed back until now. 

I get weird bursts of energy, almost like endorphins boosts. They can last all day and even late at night. I also get dips of energy, where sometimes I would even need a nap. Mentally I am more tired and distracted. I am currently very busy at work and it costs me a great deal of energy to stay focused like I usually could. I try to make use of the energy boosts (do all the house chores, do something fun with my family), and make sure I dial down a little bit before I have to go to bed. 

The first week I had muscle aches, this week that wasn't so bad.

I have lost a little bit of weight, maybe 0,5 kg. 

I must say that I have been doing Intermittent Fasting for about 1,5 months now which makes me feel great. My main goal is not to lose weight, but to lose a little bit more fat and maybe have some health benefits (who knows what it might do for my asthma/allergies since it regenerates cells and such). Unfortunately, the physical therapists don't want me to do this during rehab, seeing they ware you out. So I will start with taking breakfasts on days that I have rehab. I usually eat low carb for dinner (just protein and vegetables), I have done this for a few years, occasionally I break this habit by eating carbs at dinner. Since I started rehab I eat more carbs for dinner, especially on evenings before a rehab day. They stress the importance of taking a protein-rich meal within the hour after working out. Since I was already eating overnight oats for a few weeks, I am good in that department.

17,"So I was on Spiriva (1x); Foster (8x which is abnormally high); Desloratadine (1x), Fluticasone (nose drops); nasal douche (just saltwater). All of it for more than 6 months. My hormone balance was off (spotting, old blood). My physician couldn't find anything off in my 'samples'. My physician (I think she's good, but when it comes to this specialized stuff I have to really use my brain as well) couldn't find a clear reason other than maybe my medication usage. She advised me to 'wait it out', hormones could restore themselves or use the pill to stabilize my hormones (which I don't want because of various reasons, one of them being that I don't want to fight symptoms with more hormones). My pulmonologist suggested I would try lower my Foster doses (since it contains hormones, no matter how you look at it). Since that didn't go well fast ( I needed the puffs) he instead put me on Ipratropium (max 4x, when needed, this does not contain hormones). I am still playing with the dose a little bit and down south seems to go a little better. It takes time. To be sure  I still plan to make an appointment with a gynecologist. My pulmonologist hasn't heard anything like this before, but it could be that it's not known since women are embarrassed or something.

I've been taking Breo pretty regularly for a couple years now. It's been pretty good.. my asthma is nearly gone when I'm taking it. I've also started running and cycling a lot more this summer, so I feel like my lung capacity is doing alright. I think there are some late-summer allergens in the air that are making me flare up right now though (such as ragweed). I live in Canada.

I haven't taken my Breo for about two weeks now, and I find myself taking my rescue everyday. I tried to wean off of the Breo (taking it every other day, every two days, every three etc.) so I can ultimately quit it.. but it's not really working right now. Reason for this is because a. I'd like to try more holistic approaches to getting rid of asthma such as excercise, diet etc. and b. I'm unemployed and Breo costs \~$130 for 30 dosages without medical insurance.

Anyone ever successfully weaned off their corticosteroids/preventative inhalers? I truly felt like my asthma was going away, but it's back with a vengeance.

37,"Hello. I tested positive for COVID and today completes one week since I began to show symptoms. I have mild-moderate asthma so being diagnosed with COVID is scary but I have to stay positive. I would like to share my story with COVID and would really appreciate stories from others who also had COVID and asthma and how that was like.

**About My Asthma**

I'm a 22-year-old female with mild-moderate asthma. I take Symbicort day and night, Singulair at night, and albuterol as needed. I'm allergic to dust and my asthma seems to be induced by that and also by exercise. 

**My Symptoms**

Day 1= mild body aches, could still walk but my body did ache whenever I moved, I'd say the body aches were a 3/10, mild headache, apple watch showed me that my average heart rate was in the high 90s+low 100s the whole day, cough with light phlegm, light wheezing, those were the only symptoms and I tested positive this day

Day 2= chest tightness in the center, coughing phlegm, felt pressure behind my eyes and eyes were puffy

Day 3= coughing with phlegm, light wheezing, shortness of breath when taking a deep breath

Day 4= on/off sharp stabs in mid to upper back that occurs randomly, coughing phlegm but also getting the urge to cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness when taking a deep breath

Day 5= on/off sharp stabs in mid to upper back that occurs randomly, coughing phlegm but also getting the urge to cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness when taking a deep breath, nauseous

Day 6= coughing phlegm but also getting the urge to cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness when taking a deep breath, nauseous

Day 7= coughing phlegm but also getting the urge to cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness when taking a deep breath, nauseous

For the chest tightness and shortness of breath, I have been using albuterol to relieve those symptoms but they don't completely go away, it just lessens. For the nausea I have been drinking Gatorade which seems to calm it down, I take Pepto Bismol, and eat Maruchan noodles which are gentle on my stomach. I try to walk at least once a day 40-60 minutes a day. I have noticed that my peak flow values are rangings in the 460-490s during COVID and my normal values pre-COVID are 490-530s. I have experienced only light wheezing that goes away with albuterol. I've been taking Vitamin C and D every day. I've checked my vital signs every day and they that all been normal. The first day was the only day my heart rate was high. Surprisingly, my oxygen saturation has remained at 97-98%(which is normal for me) this whole week even though I feel short of breath and chest tightness. 

So far this is week 1 of COVID symptoms. In all honesty, these symptoms have been mild but the chest tightness and shortness of breath make my days uncomfortable but bearable. I'm hoping week 2 is the week I recover and these symptoms go away. My biggest fear is that I will develop severe symptoms in week 2. 

Please share your story if you suffer from Asthma and got COVID. I would really appreciate it and would feel less alone because at least I know there are others like me pushing through this and overcame this. I hope my story can provide some insight to others about having asthma and COVID.",Asthma,I have Covid-19 and asthma. Anyone else?,1598431951
38,"Backstory:
[skip if it’s too much]
My younger brother [16M] and I [18M] have always shared a bedroom. He has severe asthma so I’ve grown up knowing I need to remain vigilant when we’re alone. Usually this just means monitoring his symptoms and checking in. The last few days he was acting off—getting tired easily, not talking much, not sleeping, wanting to be left alone, that kind of stuff. He was also being painfully rude to me and getting defensive over minimal things, I’m not going to lie it was really getting on my nerves. He has depression and bpd as well so I know not to pick fights with him. 

What happened:
[also okay to skip]
I walked into our room last night and saw him sitting on his bed with his arms wrapped  around his knees and his face buried in them. I asked if he was okay and he said yes (really sharply, I should add), I asked if he was sure and he basically yelled “fuck you leave me the hell alone”. So it’s safe to assume I left him alone after that. I went to bed and throughout the night I kept hearing him get up, but I ignored it. At around 4 am I heard a noise and saw that he dropped his inhaler. Obviously I sprung out of bed to check on him but he was not okay. Not forming words, squeezing his eyes shut, struggling to breathe. I think there was vomit on his shirt. I got his inhaler for him but he wasn’t able to inhale or hold it long enough for it to be effective. I tried counting for him but it wasn’t working. I offered to set up his neb but he said he already did and it wasn’t helping, all in one word broken sentences. I tried walking him to our restroom to run a steam shower (as it always helped) but after a few steps of leaning heavily on me he just dropped to his knees gasping. I carried him the rest of the way and left him there as I dialled 911. I answered the operator’s questions the best I could and only went back in to get his peak flow. He was trembling and not really understanding what I was asking him to do, still, he did it and while his reading was way in the red zone he told me he couldn’t see anything. The operator assured me an ambulance would be there soon so I went to wake my parents. His lips were blue when I got back and he was conscious but not responding. Ambulance eventually came and both my parents left with him while I stayed behind. 




Current situation:
From what I’ve been told, he was in respiratory failure, his heart beat was really fast, not blood was going to the right side of his heart, and he flatlined. They gave him a bunch of treatments like oxygen, fluids, steroids, but they also intubated him and put him on BiPAP and ECMO…not really sure what those are and my search result are to medicalized for me to understand. He’s in the ICU so it’s not good. 

I am really scared. I feel like it’s my fault. I don’t know why I didn’t just wake up sooner to check up on him. Maybe all of this could’ve been avoided. He’s careful about triggers, he hasn’t left the house since quarantine started, there’s no way he’s been exposed, he’s really skinny but does the necessary exercise to stay “fit”, even his meds are at their highest dose so I can’t find a way to blame him for not taking precautions. I really feel like I should’ve been able to see red flags such as insomnia or being irritable. I don’t think I handled my emergency response well either. I have these questions if anyone can help:

How serious is his condition? I know the ICU is bad but I’m not going to lose him, right? They said he was “crashing” but he’s stabilized, only he still can’t breathe on his own. Is the long term outlook bad or is recovery easy? Is this a thing that happens with severe asthma (respiratory failure) or is this just extremely bad luck? What should I have done differently (aside from waking up sooner)? Did I do something to endanger him further? Was there something else I could’ve done while waiting for paramedics? Idk have any of you survived respiratory failure or severe asthma attacks and would you mind sharing?

47,"Hi,

First of all, sorry for the long post. Second, any advice is welcome! 

So I've been coughing for almost two months straight now. It started as a dry cough, progressed to coughing phlegm the last week. Now this morning it seemed to contain a bit of blood. All this after I struggled with shortness of breath a couple months before that (thankfully that's better now, though not completely over) following a sickness of a couple days (feverish/short of breath/trembling, the works). 

My dilemma is that I've been to the doctor 3 times over the past two months, got covid tested again (negative), but still don't have an answer where it is coming from. They just quickly listen to my lungs and measure heartrate, tell me not to worry and send me on my way. They hardly listen to what I say and I doubt going back again will make it better, but on the other hand I don't want to be brushed off that easily because I know this is very unusual for me. I've only coughed this much with pretty bad infections in the past and in the past I got antibiotics. Now they just tell me to wait it out, even though it seems pretty obvious that with a two month streak it's not really improving on its own and it's following an unusual year for me. I havent had this much shortness of breath in years. For that they also brushed me off and told me not to worry. I am 28 and can normally cycle 2/3 hours no problem, so it's kinds annoying that I got told its nothing while i would suddenly  get tired from walking just 10 mins. Right now I'm back to being able to cycle 1 hour or so, bit the cough is sticking around. 

I've also been told not to worry and to wait things out in the past too with another issue, while I was right and got some nasty consequences (untreated infection) just because I got ignored. This situation reminds me of that very much, but I don't really know what else I could do or say to get more help than a quick listen. Especially since the doctors office is pretty overwhelmed at the moment. Its kinda like you're not allowed to have anything beside covid this year cause they dont have the manpower to treat regular breathing issues anymore. 

Anyone has some advice? What are some things I could specifically ask for to not get brushed of? What kind of coughing techniques do you know? Should I ask for a photo of my lungs? Should the phlegm be examined? Is this brownish phlegm something to worry about when its only a little? 

P.s. - I know the cough in itself is not that big of a deal. I just wanna know and treat the underlying issue before there is more damage then necessary. It's the amount of time it's taking to get better and the issues before the cough too that makes me want more answers.",Asthma,"Should I keep asking for a third, fourth or fifth opinion?

48,"Hello,

I recently had an infection or illness of sorts and now my doctor is thinking I may have asthma. I am hoping to get some feedback / words of wisdom. For context, I am a 25F with no history of smoking.

At the beginning of August I had a cough start up and though I didn’t feel sick, my work requires us to get COVID tested prior to coming back in physically, so I was COVID tested and it came back negative. I still had the cough, but was starting to feel sick with on and off hot and cold sensation (no fever). I couldn’t go back to work (they’re letting me work remotely and being really flexible and supportive) since I am still coughing, so I got tested ago by an Urgent Care Dr orders and it was negative again. I had chest X-rays and it was clear, so they started me on prednisone, thinking it may be asthmatic bronchitis. I had exercise induced asthma symptoms (and did lung function tests leading to the diagnosis) when I was a pre teen playing state level soccer, but only had asthma attacks at the actual matches. Practice and even conditioning rarely resulted in flare ups or attacks, leading me to think the majority of it was related to the excitement and anxiety of the match. Once I quit soccer, I had maybe 3 asthma attacks and the occasional night time coughing fit in the past 13 years that was relieved by my rescue inhaler (albuterol). 

Anyway, I did the prednisone (5 day course) and it gave me no relief. I was still up all night coughing, it felt like there was a pressure on my chest, and breathing was hard, but I did not experience chest pain. I felt worse as the week went on. I called another Dr (this is about 3 weeks after symptoms started now) and he started me on azithromycin and gave me symbicort. By the end of the course of antibiotics, a lot of the pressure on my chest was gone and the coughing lessened significantly, but even with the symbicort (2 times a day), I was still experiencing chest tightness, lightheadedness, weakness, shortness of breath, and a cough. 

I followed up again and he repeated xrays—they’re still normal, and put me on a different antibiotic and added Spiriva. I’m only a few days in to the new antibiotic, but I still feel the same and don’t really expect it to make a difference at this point—I feel like the infection was knocked out by the azithromycin. 

To clarify, I am now on these meds for this issue:
Albuterol every 4-6 hrs as needed
Symbicort twice a day
Spiriva once a day
Doxycycline twice a day

My symptoms are (all were nonexistent prior to this respiratory issue):
Chronic cough that is easily agitated by sprays, talking, and chest tightness
Chest tightness constantly
Difficulty inhaling and exhaling (not constant, but more often than not)
Lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness when standing and moving for too long. Stairs are hard and I have to catch my breath. I was short of breath the other day and walking down the hall, everything went black and I fell; sometimes my vision gets splotchy and I get dizzy after coughing a lot or with the light headedness too.

My Dr wants me to see a pulmonologist if the symptoms don’t resolve by the end of the antibiotics which end in about 7 days. He never talked to me about suspecting full blown asthma nor did he tell me what he thought was going on exactly, but when I checked the online portal for more info, he had subacute bronchitis and asthma with acute exacerbation listed as my conditions (pending follow up after the antibiotics are done / I see a pulmonologist, I would assume). 

—-

TL;DR / Here is my confusion:
- Why am I still having these symptoms with all of these inhalers if it’s asthma when albuterol has worked well for me in the past? 

- The shortness of breath and tight chest doesn’t feel like an asthma attack—unless they’re just much less severe. If they were like the asthma attacks I had as a kid and didn’t respond to my rescue inhaler, I would have had to go to the hospital. My current symptoms are for the most part constant, low to mid level discomfort with little to no relief and occasional coughing fits. Unless I’m up and moving around—then they’re much more noticeable and hard to handle. 

- Does prednisone ever NOT help asthmatics during a flare up? I thought that it typically made a big difference for asthmatics having this sort of flare up? I’m worried this is indicative of it being something other than asthma. 

- Can you tell me more about what a pulmonologist might do as far as testing? What if I am not having trouble breathing at the time of the test?",Asthma,Confusion Post Asthma Diagnosis,1598347881
49,"I began taking it about two months ago, and since then I’ve had a few weird side effects.

My heart sometimes beats extremely fast, or there’s fluttering and palpitations, and I saw a cardiologist yesterday who, after doing an ecg, it’s giving a physiology of something close to Burgada syndrome,which is a rare genetic syndrome that can kill you in your sleep. However I’ve done heart exams every year from the ages of 10 to 18 and a couple times since then (I’m 23 now) as i was a semi professional athlete and you need to have a doctor’s note saying you’re fit for it. In those examinations which included a colour echocardiogram, an ECG &amp; other tests, it never showed up. In fact I had a very strong and healthy heart. If I had a generic syndrome or heart condition, we would know - I’m gonna do a 24 hr tape and another colour echocardiogram, to see what’s going on. The doctor said if I definitely had this condition it would show more obviously on the ECGs he did on me, whereas now there only seems to be a mild tendency for it on my results. Plus they never caught it before despite me doing extensive testing as a teen, and this disorder disproportionately affects Asian males over any other race or gender, including white women. And it’s genetic, none of my family have it. 

I got covid in March and I’m still experiencing side effects from it, but this feels like something that could be coming from Montelukast. 

Moreover I’ve been experiencing a sense of numbness and weakness in my limbs &amp; joints and that is also a side effect of Montelukast. An article I read said if you experience this stop taking the medicine and go to your doctor ASAP. 

I also have anxiety, but I spoke to my psychologist who doesn’t think my symptoms are likely to be caused by anxiety. Basically we want to eliminate the possibility of an undiagnosed genetic heart condition and if that’s out of the picture, then it’s my asthma medication causing it. (However I’d appreciate it if on the comments, you didn’t say anything about me dying... that would trigger my fears and traumas a lot)

50,"I think for many of us, this year has been terrible for anxiety. COVID fears have been terrible, my journey of discovering I had GERD was a wild ride, and now I have to worry about all of this smoke from the NorCal fires.

I used to think I had a really strange case of asthma because of the acid reflux that would get pretty high up into my chest and cause shortness of breath and massive discomfort. After trialing with acid reducers and now Zantac, I discovered it was GERD and my fears about that became a lot better and a lot of the discomfort from GERD is gone.

Then COVID hit, and any sort of discomfort in my chest, any wheeze, any cough, just shot my anxiety up for months. That's a lot better now, at least for COVID fears.

Now I'm being surrounded by horrible air quality that seems to be all accumulating in the city I live in from all directions.

As of this past week, my anxiety about my asthma has been fucking terrible. I've been really worried about my asthma because I can feel my body start to feel like shit because of the smoke (headaches, sore throat, etc) and I'm back to my mind instantly thinking that this discomfort is my asthma acting up. 

I'm on Alvesco for two shots a day, have an inhaler, take 80mg of Prozac a day to manage my depression and anxiety, and I haven't had an actual asthma flareup in a while. I've had discomforts and wheeze in my throat if I do a slightly forceful breath out of my mouth, but as of recently a lot of my issues have been managed recently. Even despite all of that though, I just can't shake the constant worry in the back of my head about my asthma. I constantly have a discomfort in the middle of my chest where my esophagus is, and my mind just always goes into thinking I'm having issues with asthma despite no trouble breathing, and then actually have trouble breathing because of the anxiety I gave myself and feed into.

my question is: does anyone else get hoarse with a cough after an attack? i believe that this is my first real asthma attack, since i’ve only really dealt with vocal cord dysfunction before, and i know how to differentiate the symptoms. i’ve never had this happen with vocal cord dysfunction.

55,"Hey everyone. I was a childhood asthmatic (30yr now) but worked hard during my high school and college years to overcome it. I have, and my asthma has been fairly dormant ever since. No inhaler, no nebulizer, nothing. It's been great! To not have to deal with asthma was a beautiful thing. But all good things must come to an end..

At the end of July, my father in law came down with COVID. By the time he tested positive, we all knew we had been exposed. The several days of him being ""just really tired"" turned out to be a full blown case of COVID complete with pneumonia. Fast forward... I had a severe (but not critical) case of COVID but suffered no apparent breathing issues *while infected*. In the week post-infection I developed tightness in my chest and could feel my airways constricting for the first time in years! This gave me chills... it was an ugly symptom that I had forgotten. Anyways, I went to my GP the next day and a spirometry test showed I was full blown asthma again. Doc prescribed Xopenex levalbuterol (since albuterol can cause tachycardia and COVID also left some unsettling heart symptoms), montelukast, and predisone. She also referred me to a pulmonologist to take a deeper look.

So, some questions:

What could I expect at the pulmonologists office? And what types of questions should I ask?

The levalbuterol has been fantastic (just like my old proair, but I've had to use it 1 - 3 times per day to keep me breathing sufficiently. I know this recurrent asthma is not well managed right now, obviously. I've never used it, but I've been on it for 7 days today. I have noticed yesterday and today I've had a lesser need for the levalbuterol. Roughly how long does it take for montelukast to start working?

My doctor called today for a follow-up and additionally prescribed Symbicort. This is also something I've never used. I've been reading on it a bit and I'm not sold that this is the maintenance I want to follow since it includes immune-weakening steroids. I'm not fond of steroids one bit and I'm about to finish a round of prednisone. The thought of immune suppressants repulses me, but obviously I'll do what I need to do.

59,"Hi everyone!

I just joined this sub because my asthma recently relapsed and I'm looking for support and guidance. I grew up with terrible breathing issues (i.e., breathing through a nebulizer every night before bed) and regular respiratory infections, but I wasn't given an official asthma diagnosis until freshman year of high school. I had a very mild case of exercised-induced asthma at age 14, saw the symptoms persist for a few years, and then disappear for about 10 years. I am 27 now and for the past few weeks, I noticed that I was becoming increasingly short of breath, sometimes taking 10 incomplete breaths before a single satisfactory one. This last week was the absolute worst and I ended up seeing my general practitioner twice, having chest x-rays done (those came back normal), and finally scheduling an appointment with an allergist to identify any triggers. I was put on an albuterol inhaler and prescribed prednisone, which is a new one for me in regards to breathing problems. Although I'm seeing improvement, I'm definitely not back to normal yet. I shared this with my doctor and she just prescribed me Flovent, which is also a new medication to me. I haven't started that yet because she just called it in this morning, but I'm hoping it will help me use my albuterol less, which I'm averaging about 6-10 puffs a day.

I've never experienced a bout of shortness of breath that has lasted this long and I guess I feel kind of frustrated, but also curious, about asthma now. I think this is because I had such a mild case before and I always thought it was like a general feeling of not being able to catch your breath after running, but this sucks!! I live a very active lifestyle and I'm scared that I won't be able to continue this, or that I will continue to experience shortness of breath for who knows how long. I also bought an air purifier and I already own a humidifier, so I'm hoping the combination of those two will help. Please understand that in no way am I trying to say that asthmatics can't lead an active lifestyle; I just haven't been able to do much of anything recently without feeling so incredibly winded and exhausted, and this is still a new diagnosis for me, so I just don't really know what to expect at the moment.

62,"So I had some pretty bad asthma as a kid growing up in Houston. I wanna say it went away completely by age 14 after doing allergy shots for a while and I never really had problems other than when I went for runs in the cold - still, nothing major. I’m now 22, live on the southern great plains in an semi-arid region, and still hadnt had problems up until a few weeks ago. 

For context, I tore my ACL back in February and had surgery in June... but I’ve practically been inactive for the whole 6 months and gained a bit of weight. I spent the summer in Houston recovering but started to notice my breathing was a bit labored. I chalked this up to me getting so much bed rest and even then, it was nothing major. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I had my first real panic attack pretty much the day I moved back to my college town. The anxiety has subsided a bit but even with that, I’ve noticed my breath feeling progressively more labored. It’s like I can fill my lungs fine, the problem is it feels like my airways are tight (no real wheezing)... but I have to catch my breath at the end of long sentences now. I was able to get a couple moderate bike rides in with no problems but the day I pushed myself, I felt like my lungs were irritated. 

My question is: Is it possible that by getting out of shape, I triggered some symptoms and by pushing myself too hard in this desert air, I exacerbated it? If so, could I ease myself back into things and hope the symptoms go away, or did I just doom myself by waking my old asthma back up? 

Further, could the anxiety have anything to do with it? I’m just troubled by these new developments because my passions sort of revolve around being around the mountains, singing, and exercising. I really cant see myself giving these things up and would hate to have to do that because of asthma.

80,"hey guys,

maybe someone on this subreddit has experienced something similar and can help me figure it out.

in March I started getting a tickle in my lung and in the course of two weeks it progressed to the point where I experienced shortage of breath (one and only day it happened though). after that it got all better. gp couldn’t hear anything in my lung, sent me to pneumologist. did the machine thing, and three weeks of peak-flow-meter - no asthma. guy didn’t do allergy test tho and told me to get it checked out elsewhere. however I had no symptoms then and until around June when it came back. made an appointment with allergy doc. prick-test negative, blood-test also all negative, not even increased IgE. but, I am so sure it’s got to do with pollen because every time I go outside it gets worse, and sometimes when I inhale to quickly, I get the urge to cough. going up a few floors by the stairs makes breathing so much harder. there has been an increase in pollen as it does in summer and along with it I also experienced an increase in tickle got an asthma-inhalor with cortison. honestly not sure if it really helps, because the tickle and everything is still there. I rather not stop taking it though in case it would get worse again. when I do the peak-flowmeter right now it still shows the same value as back when I had no symptoms. so it might not even be asthma? the dr said she'll prescribe ebastine and I should give it a try but a colleague of mine says first week he takes it he is essentially kncked out and I cannot lose a whole week at this point in time.

TL;DR: tickle in lungs, urge to cough, gets worse when i’m outside - looks like allergic asthma, but neither prick nor bloodtest indicate any kind of allergies. got tested for covid - was negative. not sure if asthma inhalor really helps. also common anti-histamines (ceterizine, loratadine) do not help at all.

I was told to take the ventolin/albuterol before exercise if I need it - I generally do especially for cardio workouts. 

So I have a few questions: 

If I exercise every day, and I take the ventolin prior to exercise every day, is that too much? 

I am still very easily out of breath, with sharp pains in the chest when I run, and my heart-rate goes crazy high after just 200-300m. All I’ve been able to do is is walk with little runs. I find the same with cycling if there are hills. But I can take dance classes for hours and hours, or walk for hours and hours. .... so the question I have is this part of the asthma issue or am I out of shape still? Or a combo? How do I tell which is which? 

And how do I work with this? I hate being stuck in tiny run walk ruts here.

Lastly, is there a specialist that works with athletes and asthma specifically? (Canadian here). I’ve had a very quick appointment with a pulmonologist who wasn’t very open to questions recently, except to confirm diagnosis and treatment, but not much else.

96,"**Background**: It's my first time on a maintenance inhaler in almost 25 years, as my allergies have been flaring up, and I've been using my rescue inhaler on average 2x-3x/week (when wheezing starts), vs once every couple of weeks and when active. 

I got sent to my clinic's Internal Medicine specialist last week for an annual-ish med review, and I was prescribed a QVAR MDI (1 puff 50 mcg, 2x daily) when I brought up the above issue. I've also got ADHD, and I really struggle to start new routines, so I've not been able to stick to the 2x/day yet (or even 1x/day really). 

Something I've noticed after taking it though, is that despite rinsing thoroughly after taking it, I'll get a very mild sore throat (almost like a pinpoint sensitive spot?) - sorta expected per the Pharmacist's briefing - **AND**  I'll also get what feels like a really nasty pinpoint itch somewhere in my middle-inner ear, like between my eardrum and throat. 

I've been super sketched out by this, as my brain immediately goes **""IS IT COVID?""**, but twice now, it's subsided within 36-48 hours of taking my previous dose (this time, I purposely stopped it to check if this was the case, as opposed to a constant symptom). In the distant past, I *believe* I was on the Pulmicort turbohaler, and I don't remember any side effects like these from taking it.

Does anyone have any insight or experience similar to mine? 

=======

Also, I had a friend tell me that a twice daily dose of ICS sounded really odd to them, as they had been told by their doc that it has a stimulant effect, and not to take it before bed. does that sound familiar to anyone, or would I be okay to pair it with my standard AM/PM medication routine?

97,"This is a long story, only if you have time to read this. Sorry it got long:

I've been wondering if I have Asthma, so here's my story... Around early Spring of this year, I started having difficulty breathing that lasted until mid April. I would feel like I need to breathe with more effort, my breathing felt heavier. Since that time until July, I felt mostly fine, no breathing problems to speak about — but I wouldn't say I felt perfect.

July comes around, and one time taking a cold shower, my breathing felt unsatisfying. Ok, it’s cold water and it can do that, but even so, my breathing felt uneasy like I couldn't take a full breath. Then I want to say, a week later, one night I had difficulty breathing again — I haven’t felt this since April. It felt heavy and labored and I didn't get sleep. Next day, I still felt the heaviness. And this goes on for a few days and then a few days I would feel better but not perfect. On a couple of nights, while lying down, I would have these weird sensations in my chest, that made me feel dizzy or lightheaded.

One week later, its a Friday night, while lying down, I felt like I couldn't breathe normally and I had to sit up really fast because I felt like I was gasping for air and felt dizzy. Sitting up, my breathing feels better but as soon as I lay down again, it becomes difficult and I couldn’t sleep. I had to be at work in the morning but technically if we have any ""symptoms"" of covid, we are suppose to let them know and I did. I had to self isolate for 10 days (luckily I still got paid). It seems like I'll be fine for a fews days and not so fine for a few days. I got tested for covid (twice) and they came back negative. I did the nasal swab and antibodies test and all were negative. So I never had covid.

After 10 days of self isolating, I returned to work and felt fine but then not so fine. It's like a repeated cycle. I saw my doctor and he said my lungs sounded normal. But I am getting a pulmonary function test soon to see what I have or don't have. He said based on what I told him, it could be asthma.

Anyways, its the weekend (last weekend August 14th) and I'm not feeling too well. Saturday night and Sunday I felt ok-ish. Later on Sunday, my breathing felt narrowed like a cooling sensation with a weird feeling in my chest, kinda dizzy but faint.

Monday (August 17th) has come and I go to work and feel fine. Later in the day, after watching a movie, I went to bed around 8pm. During this time, I felt my breathing was narrowed and weird with that cooling sensation. Around 10pm, still feeling those weird sensations and some dizziness, things turn for the worst. I had to get up really fast because lying down felt uncomfortable and I realized I was breathing fast. I sprung up feeling that I needed to gasp for air but was having a difficult time and I couldn't breath in fast enough to catch my breath. So now I'm really having a very hard time breathing and I felt like at any second I could pass out. I felt so dizzy and light-headed. I started panicking and texted a friend saying: omg I think I’m having a full blown asthma attack. It was extremely serious and I was so close to going to the hospital but after doing breathing exercises, I was able to get my breathing under control.

But that night was hell and my breathing was really labored. Honestly, it was not fun and one of the worst nights of my life, no joke. When you need air to breathe and you can’t do that, that is the worst feeling ever. And listening to Needtobreathe won’t help, fyi.

The next day (Tuesday), I still wasn’t feeling so good and my chest felt so tight and heavy and my breathing was very labored. I went to urgent care and they prescribed me steroids and Albuterol. So I talked to my therapist Tuesday night, as I already had an appointment. He said based on what I told him, with the cooling sensations and weird feelings in the chest, that I actually had a panic attack. Now I believe that was a panic attack. My episodes (since April) could have been from anxiety but part of it could be asthma too. Tuesday night, I felt much calmer and more relaxed after all that. I felt so exhausted and it felt like I hiked up a mountain.

Anyways I'm going to wrap this up... Yesterday and today I have been managing and feeling better. Last night I felt like I could have another episode and at times felt like I needed air but I felled asleep and went to work today. I felt fine today but not perfect. I picked up my Albuterol and I’m hoping that calms me down.

Do I have asthma? I’m not looking for anyone to answer that, just wanted to share my story. So I don't know and I'll have to see once I get that test done. It could also be anxiety. After all, in 2 weeks I’m moving down south, 900 miles away to a new city (my happy place) for school. Once I'm there, I think my anxiety will be much lower.",Asthma,"Asthma, Anxiety or Both?",1597966478

3,"Long story short: I aspirated what I believe to be a small piece of wood about a month ago. Next morning I had really deep coughs like something was stuck in my lung. Started developing difficulty breathing and the constant need to clear my throat. Waited a week to see if it would go away before seeing a doctor. I did a CT scan which showed a possible foreign object in left lung. Did a bronchoscopy which didn’t turn anything up. Doc thinks it’s asthma. Since then, I’ve been having really bad coughing fits any time I exercise. I’ve had headaches and nausea from coughing. I also get chest pain on the left side of my chest. When I cough, it vibrates my left lung and makes a wheezing noise. Sometimes, my coughs also have a blood-like taste but I have clear sputum. 

I honestly think I have a small object in my lung but I want to know what y’all think?

When I was younger it was bad enough to make trips to the hospital or emergency room after Nebulizer and rescue inhaler wouldn’t work. A few ER trips in high school as well. Also exercise, laughing, being sick, alcohol, and dust will trigger an attack. Sounds like a lot but growing up with it I’m used to it! And my rescue would help right away. 

As I got older it wasn’t as bad. But in the past year it’s been out of control. I’ve been on all the usual meds and what I landed on was a Flovent steroid which pretty much eliminated my asthma! But, this past year has been rough. Almost having asthma attacks every morning and night and sometimes during the day. Not so much wheezing but chest being sooo tight and can’t get a breath. Also after my inhaler my face gets so flushed and hot, feels like all the blood is rushing to my head.

7,"Hi all. Im a 19 year old living with severe allergies and recently I got diagnosed with allergic asthma after having a couple summers of difficulty breathing. This seriously affects my life in a terrible way. It causes me to extremely anxious and depressed because I feel as if I ruined my life. I have a lot of party like tendencies like drinking and was a previous smoker/vaper. I cannot help but thing I have messed up my life to the point of no return. I am not a kid that has anxiety or depression either so coping with it is not the easiest thing. Even tho I have been diagnosed with asthma I cant help but think that I have COPD. I have no idea why I cant this idea out of my head but it scares me so much because my future is very promising.

I got the allergy test at the start of the summer and my back was lit up like a Christmas tree. They gave me a rescue inhaler, monolukast sodium, and a QVAR inhaler that I take 2 puffs 2 times a day but have since switched to a different inhaler because it wasnt helping like it should have. Im allergic to more things than not and I am getting allergy shots to make me not allergic to anything anymore. I have every symptom ever along with GERD and Chronic Costrocondritus. I think that this is because of the inflammation response from the allergies and the GERD definitely doesn't help.

Allergies are not something that are foreign to me either. As a child I had tons of food allergies and my parents had to get me special foods or else I would get hives all over my body. I also had eczema that has since been treated so I'm the perfect candidate for allergic asthma (hence why I was diagnosed).

All of my friends live great healthy lives and it makes me upset that I cant participate in certain things with them because of these restrictions. I guess all I'm asking for is reassurance or maybe even if other people can relate to how I feel because I feel like I can't live like this forever.",Asthma,Allergic Asthma,1597877736

12,"Hi everyone, 

I have recently been undergoing tests for Asthma, i have to keep a peak flow diary. And take a blue pump (ventolin Evohaler) twice a day after I've taken my peak flow. And I'm not sure if I'm using the pump right, I have a spacer/chamber. I use it between 7-8am, and 4-5pm. 
I started using the pump the 14th August and sometimes when I use it, it relieves my symptoms quickly and I feel like I'm breathing through new lungs, but other times I don't feel any relief at all, and feel like I need to take more as my breathing just isn't right.  

My peak flow meter should be high 300s but I'm blowing 200-300 when I'm testing before using my pump. 

Could it be that I don't have asthma, or is it that I'm using the pump wrong? Or, could it just be the weather currently as I live in the UK and its been a mixture of raining and cold and then humid and boiling. Or, is it that i just need to get used to the medication?

I just don't learn that rejecting it doesn't mean it rejects me...) Instead I use it when it gets to the point where I'm coughing not really breathing very successfully. Now I've started getting nauseous when I have an attack and after the rescue inhaler does it's thing, the nausea goes away. Is that a normal asthma symptom?

I developed shortness of breath at rest around three weeks ago. I've been feeling a pretty persistent ""air hunger"" and feel the need to sigh or yawn often to feel like I'm getting enough air. I've had chest tightness, especially when I attempt to take deep breaths, and I feel like my airway is a little swollen. 

I've had a couple episodes of near-syncope, but I've pretty much chalked that up to hyperventilation and panicking about my SOB. I had one of these episodes last Wednesday, and ended up going to the ER. All of my blood work was normal, my oxygen saturation was fine, and my chest x-ray was fine. Could this be adult onset asthma? Anyone experience anything similar?

47," Hi everyone. I was kind of informally diagnosed with asthma back in April. Still no official diagnosis and my doctor and I are still feeling it out, but he’s said this is most likely what it is. Mostly just writing this to vent and see if anyone here might have any insight or advice into whats going on with me.

Like I said I got it back in early April. I realized one evening that I couldn’t fully catch my breath. I started to panic, thinking I’d caught COVID. I’d just been to a wedding right before lockdown started and assumed I must have caught it there. I got an assessment to get a covid test and the doctor said I didn’t have covid but likely had asthma. She gave me a chest X-Ray that came back clear of any worrying signs.

Fast forward to now and I’ve seen my GP about it and have been taking Zyrtec, Flonase, Montelukast, &amp; Breo Ellipta every single day and I still feel just as shitty. Every day I have a baseline persistent difficulty breathing and then it will spike and get even worse seemingly at random. I have an albuterol inhaler but every time I use it it never seems like it’s working. My doctor saw me in person once since this started and did a few breathing tests and said I seem fine. He said there’s nothing I should worry about, which is frustrating. I don’t feel fine.

The worst part is the lack of sleep. I can’t lie flat anymore, so I basically made a cushion fortress on my couch to be able to sleep sitting up. It’s not very comfortable. I used to be able to sleep decently like that, but now lately I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night, gasping for air - it feels like I’ve been holding my breath the entire time while I was asleep. I often get a sense of dread before going to sleep that I’m going to suffocate in the middle of the night. It’s a really cool &amp; fun feeling to have.

Two of the main ways I’ve been able to feel even brief relief are to drink water and to burp. It often feels like there is air stuck in my throat and I’ve found these are two ways to relieve that. Not sure how typical that is. 

I’ve told all of this to my doctor but he keeps telling me to keep taking my medicines and call back in a month and update him on how I feel. I told him I’d like if we could outline an action plan, try X medication for Y months, if that doesn’t work, we try this different treatment. But he hasn’t done that. I’m seeing a pulmonologist on the 24th who I’m hoping will be more helpful. 

The lack of sleep in combination with the persistence of my symptoms along with COVID lockdown have really taken a toll mentally as well and has caused me to feel exhausted and depressed at all times of the day. I was a pretty upbeat guy before this, even during lockdown. I’m trying to work out as much as I can (I just got Ring Fit for the Switch) but there are days where I barely get anything done at work or don’t have the energy to talk to my friends because I feel so miserable.

Anyway, sorry for the long incoherent rant. Mostly just looking for some general advice/guidance on living with asthma. Is everything above normal for people with asthma to feel? Anything I could be doing differently outside of my medication? At this point I'm truly baffled how people live with this. I'm barely 6 months in i'm at my limit.

Also in case it matters/ helps here’s a master list of all my symptoms that I’ve been tracking to give to my doctor.

* Every day:
   * Difficulty Breathing
   * Fatigue
   * Burping
   * Difficulty breathing when lying flat
   * Didn’t used to have difficulty sitting on the couch, but now do.
* Frequent but not every day:
   * Nausea
   * Coughing (dry cough)
   * Back pain/discomfort
* Uncommon or potentially unrelated symptoms:
   * Dry hands/ skin flaking off hands
   * Throwing up in mouth. Only happened a couple times but def more than once.
   * Occasional lack of appetite 
   * Fingers MAYBE starting to turn blue? But Might just be seeing things. They look better/worse in certain lights. Frequently look blue in the shower. How obvious would this be?
   * Due to frequency of fatigue/symptoms I have been feeling a depression/lack of motivation at work and to engage in social life.",Asthma,New to the whole asthma thing,1597509875

Following the advice of you guys since my Gastro doctor’s appointment is at the end of the month, I took Omeprazole in the am and pm with 1 pepcid also at pm. The day before yesterday I had to go to the hospital at about 11pm because my asthma suddenly got worse and nothing was helping.

2. Pantoprazole 40mg (am) 
3. Mylanta after meals and before laying down (only take it if i really need it) 
4. 2 Pepcid pilla of 20 mg (pm)

Fast forward to yesterday I did a PFT and did 130% of my predicted function. Then we did an albuterol treatment to see if I could improve beyond that and I did 132% which is a negligible increase since its more likely I just performed better than it is the albuterol caused it (in the words of the tech and opinion of the pulmonologist).

I've had 'atypical' asthma all my life - as a child I'd get blue in the face for lack of oxigen, but there would be no wheezing. It was pretty manageable from my teenage years on, with the occasional flare up or infection. Medication-wise I was always on a corticosteroid with ventolin as a rescue inhaler. I'm now 30, and since last year my lungs have been acting up again. There was an incident at my work where I inhaled a lot of citric acid, and since then things have worsened significantly. 

The absolutely infuriating thing is that when it's really bad, I can't get enough oxigen, get dizzy, I walk for a minute and need to sit down and recuperate, but my oxigen levels and the blowing test (sorry idk what it's called, English is not my first language) are all great.  
It goes extremely fast now too, for example: sunday and monday I was fine, did some light exercise and went biking. Since tuesday my chest is super tight, medication seems to barely work, I get exhausted super easily, throat hurts like it's blocked.

84,"I typically use a rescue inhaler and I keep one for everyday use.  I've tried to write this post three times on my phone and accidentally deleted it, so I'm going to make it short.  

Daily user of rescue inhaler, Albuterol.

Due to the covid-19 scare in the healthcare situation in United States, I have allowed my inhaler to lapse.  I am currently using a nebulizer at home with albuterol sulfate solution.  it seems like I'm getting a lot more bang for my buck and this medication is helping me and to go longer between treatments and not rely on an inhaler so much.  I've had a couple times while I was away from home and had a hard time but overall it's been pretty good experience.  

Well I have every intention of getting an inhaler as soon as I can, I'm having a problem with my nebulizer right now that I would like to fix.  last night the telephone, or the pitch of the compressor changed a little bit and it seems like it's not putting out as much air as it was before.  Thus, it's not making as much ""steam"" as it used to.  The medication is still coming out but I feel like if I was actually in distress I would have a bad time of it because I don't think it would help me fast enough.  

That may or may not make sense to all of you but I don't want to rely upon a crippled nebulizer and no rescue inhaler.

I'm pretty broke right now as I've just started a new job, but I was trying to ask if anybody has any suggestions for rigging a nebulizer compressor at home.  Do any of you know if an electric bicycle tire pump or any other type of home air compressor would be sufficient? 

I have seen some nebulizers on OfferUp and LetGo but the people selling them seem to want too much, and again, things are very tight.  Of course my health comes before everything else, but if I can do something to get my nebulizer medicine working without having to spend money that would be a great help.  I mean wouldn't it be great if everything was free?

Anyway, I made my way through a bit of yoga last week, other than some bad soreness I was ok.

So about two weeks ago I was taking some steroid pills that help with inflammation (prescribed by pulmonologist) and a nebulizer 4 times a day, 6 hours apart. I started to notice improvement almost immediately compared to Arnuity which literally did nothing and was the reason I changed doctors. And since last Thursday, I finished my pills and went on to start my daily Symbicort dosis with Singulair at night. My nebulizer therapy would now be use only as rescue. 

Yesterday, after advancing to the next step and been taking Symbicort since Thursday, I had an asthma attack. Rushed to nebulizer and it didn’t improve much, waited for the night dosis of Symbicort and still didn’t improve that much. And now today I drank some black coffee, took my morning dosis of Symbicort and my nebulizer and I only feel slightly better... is this normal??? My doctor is supposed to call me back later.

But anyway the whole reason behind this post so I don't ramble on is I have 3 wild and crazy sons. The oldest is 4 years old, then I have a 2 year old, and my baby boy is 7 weeks old. I provide for them fully on my own with no help from anyone. Their father has a lot of issues with him being depressed and things like that and who started to get violent with me and our boys. When the newborn was being born it pushed him over the edge and he decided to leave us and as of now still says his decision is that he doesn't want to be involved at all in his boy's lives. Only problem is he will not help me at all with any financial help or support for the kids. He said he wants away from it all but that won't happen because I went right away and filed for an immediate court date to get child support from him because he should have to support his children even if he chooses to miss out on their life. **You guys I hate having to tell anyone that I am struggling to feed my boys and struggling to buy diapers and wipes for them.

I did have a little bit of money put aside for the monthly needs such as diapers, wipes, food, and medications but my son had a huge asthma attack and couldn't breath due to bronchitis and had to be flown to children's hospital and I had to pay a family member to keep my other two boys while I was with my son in hospital. **So even though hate every second of asking for help I have to ask because sitting here this morning I had to watch and hear my oldest two toddlers cry and tell me they were hungry And asked me if we could go get breakfast. I had to tell them no explains been that mommy didn't have any money but mommy is going to make a way to get food for all of us, diapers, baby wipes, and get his asthma medication and onhalor field and pick it up from the pharmacy somehow today.

I know that it kinda sounds like cold symptoms, but it feels much different. It's a little hard to explain. It started when the heat wave hit, when the fields around me were being plowed, having the doors open, and us using our fans on constantly.

Anyway, do my symptoms sound typical? My symptoms used to be acute. I would be chilling out, and then bam, I can't breathe.

I just completed a PFT confirming what I already suspected 
I have mild asthma. 
I'm a 25 year old with 5 years active duty in the U. S military.

I'll be honest in saying I wasn't really sure before my PFT, if it was all in my head or what was going on. I just knew that I went from being able to run a mile in 8 minutes to struggling through in 15 minutes per mile depending on the day. 



I'm still coming to terms with how this could impact my military career , let alone the changes in my physical capability. I feel like without my inhaler I can barely run without keeling over but with 2 puffs I become a track star or at least I feel like a 25 year old again. Even with the inhaler I'm nowhere where I used to be. I've been taking montekulast but it doesn't really seem to have much of an effect on me for my exercises, it certainly helps otherwise. Is this normal? Does anyone have any recommendations on how I could improve my running. Is it normal to suddenly develop Asthma? Is there a possibility for me to get back to where I used to be or should I start adjusting my expectations?

46,"Greetings, I’ve had asthma for a year or so (again, had as a kid, but it passed) and I’m able to manage it for the most part.

My asthma developed while I was switching to a ketogenic diet, and I quickly noticed how BADLY sugars and carbohydrates (all kinds) triggered my asthma. So I’m now carnivore and regularly fast (intermittent and extended), both of which also seem to keep my symptoms largely under control.

Perfumes and smokes seem to set me off the most, usually causing tightness in chest, mucus overflow, and serious inflammation-sometimes it feels like my lungs are...tender. Kind of like pulling a muscle...but lungs. I usually do regular breathing exercises, but they’ve been feeling somewhat more strenuous as of late. Granted, it could be from reduced physical activity, but it feels a little different than just not being where I was before winter.

I have a twice daily advair and take montelukast at night.  Came across studies about a “Chinese herb blend”, consisting of red reishi, Chinese licorice, and red reishi.  I add ashwagandha and apple cider vinegar. Doing this 2-3 times a day seems to help keep more serious symptoms at bay, and makes it easier to breath if my asthma does start to get triggered.

I’ve found limited success with a shot of apple cider vinegar (on its own) when I start to have issues breathing.

Recently started trying DongQuai and Turmeric/Piperine alongside the above mentioned “potion”, but I’m not 100% sure how much they’re helping in addition.

Has anyone else found success with these? Or is there anything else other people recommend?  Been doing research into bio hacking supplements that might help, but there’s a lot of supplements and information out there.

Was diagnosed in February, after having a spirometry done. On the results sheet, it listed my lung age as 44... I’m 20F, at the time was very active, working out half an hour a day five days a week. That’s why is gone to get checked anyway, as I’ve been so inactive all my life, when I started pushing my limits with running etc I found myself wheezing...

So my question is, how concerned should I be about my 44 year old lungs? I was already doing the right things with exercise and have never smoked so is there little hope for improving this? I’m also really confused as my asthma is mild - never had a proper attack, had little cause to use blue inhaler.

Years of consistent wheezing and thousands of dollars spent on doctors and meds, I have finally put two and two together.

I went to see pulmonologist and test for asthma came negative, so he wanted to put me on Xolair shots. I did not want to do that, so I decided to manage this using pills and inhalers. It was always strange to me how I have no other symptoms (runny nose, itchy eyes etc) rather than throat wheezing, and inhalers and pills were not doing much.

I have cut out stevia for couple days and wheezing disappeared. Now it all makes sense to me why I feel better when I visit someone or go on a vacation, it is because I do not use fucking stevia in my coffees. I have always thought my allergies are airborne and never thought it is something I am ingesting that is causing this chronic wheezing.

67,"Sorry if you're all sick of people asking this question, I'm sure it comes up often.

I was having constant air hunger for months, literally from waking up to falling asleep. These days it's not constant but it happens every once in a while, and I achieved that improvement by teaching myself to not crave deep breaths - keeping my breathing shallow because when I try to take deep breaths most of the time I can't. It's like there's not enough oxygen in the room, or my lungs won't take as much air as I need them to. Breathing out is fine.

Oxygen saturation is good, I did catch it fall to 90 a few times but I think that was an error with my oximeter. Plus an EMT listened to my chest and said my breathing sounded clear (while I was having symptoms)

Now I'm about ready to accept this as anxiety and for the most part I have, but there are two reasons making me cautious.

1. Sometimes I have coughing fits. I've had them for years and they don't happen at the same time as the shortness of breath. Basically it feels like one side of my neck starts burning and I can't stop coughing at all, plus my eyes water. The only thing that makes it go away is drinking water, although sometimes even that takes a long time. It doesn't happen often, sometimes I can go months without it. It happens more often if I have a cold/sore throat. It's severe enough that I don't leave the house without a bottle of water, just in case. I could never figure out why it happens but with asthma it would make sense.
2. Once when I was around 17 we were trying to make reactions happen in Chemistry class. I can't remember for sure but I think were working with simple ethanol. I breathed it in and suddenly I couldn't breathe at all, like literally at all. It passed quickly enough that I didn't even alert anyone, so probably lasted around 30 seconds and then I managed to cough and was okay. The thing is no one else had that problem.

I have had asthma for about 2 years now and am still getting used to everyday life with it. Before COVID i got on with my everyday life and took my medication as told. But nobody told me about everyday tasks that must be done like cleaning or spraying air freshener in a room.  So since the start of COVID i have been wearing a disposable surgical type mask (made sure it stated non-medical) but when it comes to cleaning or spraying the room i have discovered that wearing a mask helps with that issue of the chemical or aerosol (apologies if it spelt wrong) getting on my chest and causing my chest to tighten. So wearing a mask has helped reduce it.

My question is that is it possible to get a mask that i can wear just for cleaning and stuff like instead of using the surgical masks i were when i leave the house.

83,"TLDR: asthma bad. 

Can anyone share their experiences as I feel a bit isolated and scared.

I'm 24F (UK)  had asthma since I was 4 but worst effects I've had is chest infections a few times a year. Since 2017~ (3 years) my asthma has been getting worse and worse.

I've been in hospital 3/4 times in the past 13 months. Twice in resus, once I very very nearly died. I was in hospital &amp; resus this week, and I just feel like it's getting worse quite fast.

For context - I'm currently on seretide acuinhaler, montuklast and my normal blue rescue. I've had the antibiotics &amp; steriods emergency pack 4 times since March. Having mild asthma attacks at least once a fortnight sometimes once a week. 

I've lost 2 stone in lockdown to try and help my chest but now my chest is bad I'm struggling to exercise further. 

I've got an urgent referral to an asthma clinic in 2 weeks and been told to keep a peak flow diary &amp; allergy blood test as they can't do much untill I get to the clinic. They're saying it's most likely brittle/severe asthma. 

I just feel so scared lately about it (which won't help the asthma I know.) that even with the amount of steriods and drugs they gave me I still am struggling - albeit not as much as when I was in hospital!

Triggers include; laughing, exercise, smoke/vaping, pollution, dust, sprays. (every bloody thing at the moment) possibly an unknown allergy?? 

I'm sorry for the rant, I don't think it is very coherent but I'm just frightened that's it's only going to get worse and I don't know what is making it so bad.

Any one else experience this at my age? Or tips to help avoid triggers. Thanks for reading this far!",Asthma,Sudden uncontrolled asthma,1596395547
84,"So I’ve had asthma my whole life, it’s always been exercised induced at its worst. I also get it with allergies and anxiety, but the most debilitating is when I do any sort of cardio. 

I’ve literally never gone on a run and stopped due to muscle fatigue, it’s always my HR peaking because I’m wheezing and I can’t get oxygen. I average 180 on 3 mile runs and peak up to 200 if I’m trying hard.

For some background, I’m a 24F, 5’0 and 125lbs. I don’t know if I would identify as an athlete per se, but I did track in high school, I’ve been a rock climber for the last 10+ years, and I did a half marathon last year. When I was training for my half marathon, I still felt asthmatic, but I was getting a little faster. 

Since then, my activity level has slowed down a little bit. With graduating college, Covid, and some possible mold allergens, I haven’t been climbing as much, running as much, and my asthma has been really bad. We just moved and I’m on singulair and symbicort, which has helped my allergic asthma. Getting out of the slumlords house has also helped...no more mold. 

I’m frustrated because even though I’m not running as much as I was before, I’m running like 12 min miles. I take albuetrol 20-30min before a run, and sometimes I need it multiple times through out, and I still don’t really feel 100% during exercise. I averaged 10.5 min miles during my half marathon, which is fast for me and my lil legs. 

I had a PFT last week, and my results came back normal. This isn’t surprising because I wasn’t having an exacerbation in that moment. My GP is asking if I would like a referral for a pulmonologist. 

My question is, if singulair, symbicort, and albuterol aren’t helping me during exercise, am I just out of shape? My background (and maybe ego) make me feel like I shouldn’t be out of breath on a light hike and that I should be running quicker than 12 min miles. I worry seeing a specialist will just result in “keep training it’ll get better” and then I’ll be $100 down from a copay.

I went for a hike up a mountain this past week as I've been on vacation and it was a struggle. Ive always been pretty active my whole life, though i do know that my cardio is worse than other people even when I am still more active than them.

My wife has asthma and she has a peak flow meter so I tried that multiple times and the highest I could get it is 470 and based upon my research that is pretty low. I'm a male, 5' 11"". I did read though that might just be my lung capacity and might not mean that I have asthma.

I'm on vacation for the next week and am a bit discouraged as I have been having some shortness of breath and have been sleeping like crap for the most part, waking up randomly.

Since starting the inhaler and injections my chest now just feels a little heavy but not really short of breath anymore. All of my asthma tests have come back good showing no signs of actually having asthma. The only test that shows any positive is having pretty bad allergies. 

The main constant during this whole episode has been postnasal drip. I feel like I’m always clearing my throat. In addition to the inhaler and injections, I’ve added a nasal spray, nasal rinse, and 1 a day allergy pill.

When I was 12 I was on my junior high cross country team and could run a 7 minute mile. When I was 13 I had to quit because I could barely run for a quarter of a mile. My dad, also an asthmatic, mentioned in passing to my pediatrician during a check up (my sister's check up actually) that I had asthma and the doctor prescribed me an Albuterol inhaler with zero follow up. I read the instructions that came with it and basically followed that. Every few years I'd notice it was expired and would bring that up at the next doctors appointment where they'd just write me a new prescription for the inhaler with zero questions. The reason I was so lax about the inhaler is it didn't really help but I didn't really think much of that because I just kind of assumed that this was what asthma was and if the inhaler didn't really help then that was a me issue and I really wish that literally any doctors had bothered to talk to me about asthma or ask me literally any questions.

I'm consistently worrying about my asthma and personal health, which is causing an obvious chain reaction in a cycle, and as a result I get shortness of breath and chest tightness/irritation. I've also even given myself a sore throat.

In addition to allergy induced asthma, I have exercise induced asthma as well. I've been out of shape so I'm easily affected and have been trying to reverse that for the past month. 

I've been going for nightly/bi-nightly walks to build up my endurance but afterwards I get feelings in my upper chest near the bottom of my neck (slight tightness, some irritation; mostly just a constant feeling in that area, even when I'm holding my breath) which is what I feel is anxiety induced. I don't think it's asthma due to the fact that I get relief the less I miraculously think about it, and then back to being uncomfortable the more I do.

So for those who have problems similar to mine, what do you do?

I'm writing this, because I am fairly new to asthma (a year since I was diagnosed), and I don't think I had any real big asthma attacks until now.

I went to the doctor and they recommended that I continue with the Advair, but using it twice daily, and add Symbicort as a rescue inhaler. I was surprised and asked them to confirm.

Last November, I got sick. I was coughing so strongly for a month that I was sore and couldn't sleep. What little sleep I did get was on a couch. It finally mostly went away, with occasional coughing fits, but they were rare. Then I got sick in March. Sore throat, mild fever, no more coughing than I was already doing. After it was gone, I couldn't knock shortness of breath, some low oxygen numbers (taken with my galaxy s9), and the coughing. Got a telemedicine visit in April, got a steroid inhaler and rescue inhaler. Neither seemed to help but I kept up with them and things eventually went away. 

I figured that my asthma was just exacerbated by the two illnesses and had hoped that when I got things under control, I could stop. I started it again because I'm having some very noticeable shortness of breath that is only made better by laying prone or on my side. However, my oxygen numbers have all been good. No coughing. Allergies are managed, but I get winded by small things that I'm not normally, like picking up the kids toys or walking up a half flight of stairs.

57,"First post here but this was the only place I could think to ask at this time.

I had more severe asthma as a kid, grew out of it and now the only time I ever had attacks was when I worked at Petco and had to clean the animal habitats (but even without the inhaler it would go away after getting away from the area). I take Montelukast as a controller and Pro-air as a rescue. Have never smoked anything or any recreational drugs and rarely drink alcohol. 

Now I work at Lowe's and on the 20th and 21st they wanted us to spray paint some dirty shelf beams. Completely new experience as I've never had to deal with paint there before, but I was like ""Okay I guess"". The first day I didn't really spray paint myself but I was working around it and we were only wearing our COVID masks and nothing else (mine was cloth with a filter insert). I was smelling it for around 15 mins while they were spraying it (although I don't know how long the chemicals stay in the air). Next day I actually sprayed it myself with just that mask on not really thinking about it being too harmful. I used it for about 3-5 mins because it was only a few beams but I worked in that area for a while.

My asthma never triggered while doing it or any time during my shift. The first time I felt a little off was while driving home I got a little short of breath for a few mins but nothing major. The next day I was feeling fine, but there was a nagging scratchiness in the back of my throat but not enough to say it was a sore throat. Hours later I started feeling more and more short of breath, but nothing like asthma attack bad. On the 23rd it just got much worse like I was at 70% capacity for hours at a time with it dipping lower and going back up. Inhaler would help bring it back to about 85% but it wouldn't last long and go back to that 70%. I also started coughing on this day. I got a COVID test done because that was my first assumption, but it came back negative 2 days ago.

I stopped going to work because it got so bad I couldn't go work for even 30 mins without having an attack. I went to an UC on the 26th because it was so bad I couldn't sleep because of the SoB, I would have attacks that my inhaler didn't feel like it was fixing and I just was having to use my inhaler way more times than I was supposed to. They said it was bronchitis (didn't do a chest scan) and they gave me antibiotics and Methylprednisolone. I started those but that same night I had another bad attack and went to the ER. They chest x-rayed me and gave me an EKG and they said everything looked squeaky clean with no signs of infection. So at this point I was stumped (and kinda relieved) because I've never had any problems before and I haven't had any new experiences that I thought could've triggered this. I made an appointment with a pulmonologist, but the earliest appointment was August 10th. 

So here I am on another restless night, trying to figure out what this could possibly be and recounting everything that happened in my life before I started getting sick and that's when it hit me about the spray paint. I didn't know for sure but it was the only thing I could think of that could make this happen so I just looked it up a little earlier. Lo and behold, spray paint is known to not only trigger asthma attacks, but also cause people without asthma to develop asthma. Specifically a chemical called isocyanate.

My question is has anyone experienced this before? I can understand getting triggered at the point of contact, but it's been almost a week and my breathing hasn't went back to normal.

I went into full panic mode when I saw the pink phlegm BUT I figured as long as I wasnt developing new symptoms from using th inhaler I'd be fine.

Now here I am almost a full month later and it's the only inhaler I use. Here's why: 1. It's over the counter and I don't have insurance. And 2. I genuinely believe that it works better than my albutoral. I feel that the albutoral, while providing somewhat quicker(instant) relief my Primatene only takes about a minute longer but seems to REALLY clear out my chest of phlegm. I mean after I take it I cough up huge chunks of phlegm (still with pinkish hue) but after I do my lungs feel infinitely lighter and clearer. My chest is relieved of that tight and heavy feeling that sometimes remains when intake albutoral even though my attack is relieved. 

In conclusion: while I am aware that this might not be everyone's experience, I do find that being a smoker causes my asthma to worsen due to lots of thick phlegm that builds up in lungs and the Primatene actually helps clear it out versus just giving me temp airway relief. It also seems to last much longer. I used to have to take my albutoral 2-3 times a night but I take primatene once before bed l, cough up all the disgusting cramp and I'm gucci.

On June 12 is when it all started. It began with bronchospasm which was diagnosed a week after. Another week after that I was diagnosed with mild persistent asthma. Doctor prescribed me “Arnuity Ellipta (Fluticasone furoate inhalation powder)” and Singulair before bed. 

At the same time, my right hand started to feel a lot of pain due to an old fracture years ago and my horrible sleeping position lol. Pain was bad, visited a physician, he prescribed Cortisone and BAM pain went away BUT I also was breathing normally again, couldn’t believe it. 

Once I finished my dosis, it was around July 6 or so that I went back to stage 1. Basically, i had the tightness in my chest again, bit of difficulty breathing (especially at night) &amp; I’ve been taking Albuterol at least twice a day to rescue me from this hell and now my pulmonologist prescribed me Claritin and a Nasal Spray. 

Current status: 

—&gt; I wake up at 8am and I can control it until 4pm, Albuterol comes to the rescue and I use it again before I go to sleep. Pretty much everyday. 


What Im taking in the morning: 
1) Arnuity 
2) Omeprazole
3) Vitamin D3 
4) Claritin

What Im taking at mid day: 
1) Pycnogenol
2) Probably a puff of Albuterol

In the past I have breathed in some dust or something on windy days outside and end up going 24 to 36 hours with a tight chest where its hard to breath. I just deal with it and chest gets sore and end up falling asleep at night after laying in weird positions that seem to help until I sleep a lot of it off and deal with it in the morning as I slowly recover over 24 to 36 hours.

Its happened like 4 or 5 times in my life. In high school I went to hospital as a walk in normal visit and when they finally got to me they said it wasnt asthma and gave me some plastic thing to breath with and I think an inhaler to take home that was a circle disc, its been a while.

Anyway I went outside to clean the yard and im just concerned it will happen again since it was very windy.

I have:

* Proair HFA (albuterol sulfate) 90 mcg per actuation EXP 06/2019

I am a recovering drug addict with almost 3 years sober, my asthma was not bad in my adolescence but I occasionally needed to go for a breathing treatment if things got bad when I was sick. I also smoked cigarettes for 10 years and recently quit, my asthma seemed to have gotten noticeable in the last three years and now it is to the point where I have sought medical attention. I am 25 years old.

I went for a PFT and methylcholine(idk how to spell it) challenge and was positive for asthma but did not respond well to the albueteral, rescue inhalers don’t help much either.

My doctor started me on prednisone for 5 days, and then I will switch to using symbicort inhaler twice a day with a follow up in two weeks.

if anyone has any success stories I could really use some hope right now, my breathing has gotten very bad to the point were simple things that use to make life great for me are chores, like riding a bike to work, or playing a casual game of soccer, or going to the gym, even just reading a book can be difficult as I’m trying to get a deep breath and cannot.

Also, how did you guys and gals react to these medications I’ve listed if you’ve tried them?
Anyone here in my situation where the rescue inhalers don’t help much find something that works?

Everything was fine (xrays and chest ct scan, cardiac etc) and it was “probably my weight” until I had the breathing test.

My issues is, I don’t have any other asthma symptoms, and albuterol does nothing for me (even nebulized). I have a peak flow meter which shows me exhaling like a champ, I even have a volumetric exerciser which shows me breathing in just fine.

I'm looking to get an antibody test soon to confirm this).

50,"Hello everyone. I have a question about kids with COVID-19 and kids with asthma. 

We have two boys that are four years old and one and a half and both of them have asthma and we are trying to make the difficult decision whether to send them back to school in September. Our oldest is fine most of the year but when he would catch what is to most just an every day cold, his asthma would kick in and we would have had to take him to the hospital emergency department several times due to difficulty breathing. To be a bit more graphic about the extent of these bad episodes, in one of the last trips we wondered whether he may go unconscious during the drive to the hospital from so much coughing and difficulty breathing or whether we should send him in an ambulance. In the hospital they usually give him steroids or help him breathing with a nebulizer after which he recovers. 

Both of them have been taking their asthma medication as per the doctor’s instructions as a safety precaution in case of COVID-19. We have been reviewing and reading extensively and speaking to doctors and nobody can say for certain based on the current information whether they may be at risk if they were to catch COVID-19. Our main concern was that if they had additional difficulty breathing due to COVID-19 combined with their asthma, which is listed as one of the added risk conditions for COVID-19, that this type of sickness could possibly be fatal for such small children. 

We are confident that both the daycare and the junior kindergarten class that they might be attending will be following the strictest of protocols in sanitizing and to protect the children from any type of exposure to COVID-19. After reviewing extensively, one of the things that we discovered was that children were first of all less likely to contract the virus and secondly, their bodies react to it differently often times showing symptoms as seen in Kawasaki disease and not affecting their breathing. 

We are having much trouble in deciding whether to send them to school in September or to keep them home for a year with me not working to care for both. We obviously would prefer that they go back to school if they are not at risk of dying.

My asthma got a little better as I grew up, and was really only triggered by extreme stress - either physical exertion or severe emotional (dis)stress.

My whole life I've had albuterol inhalers. But now I'm a broke adult living in America. I can't afford to go to a doctor to get special permission to breathe. The inhalers are expensive enough, and a simple look back at my LONG history with the local pharmacy chain shows that I have in fact been prescribed inhalers my whole life. 

I just ran out of my last inhaler. A buddy with a chronic liver/pancreas problem had 6 or so that he had been prescribed for some reason or another but which he never needed or used, and those were an absolute Godsend. 

But now I don't know what to do. With covid, I've heard that inhalers are in short supply because non-asthmatics bought them all up thinking they would help if they contracted the virus, so I imagine they're more expensive than ever. Regardless, I can't afford to get a prescription to to buy one in the first place.

It was really traumatizing but the next periods I had mild asthma attacks.

55,"Last Thursday on the 9th I woke up, barely able to breathe, and made my way to the emergency room, they gave me some nebulizer treatment, prescribed me some steroids, and sent me home. Same shit that's been happening for almost 3 decades now. 

This day was different though... I got back home and my asthma started acting up again. I used my home nebulizer for close to an hour... But NOTHING happened. 

No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get a full breathe of air, and things got worse and worse. I called an Uber, went back to the ER, and on my way there it got progressively harder and harder to breathe. Not gonna lie people... I was panicking. It has never been this hard to breathe in my entire life. 

At the ER they tried giving me more nebulizer treatment, but nothing was happening. I felt my consciousness fading. No matter how hard I tried I to get a lung full of air nothing happened. I no longer had the ability to string together more than a few words, and I was passing out. 

I kept fading in and out of consciousness, refusing to pass out (out of fear of dying) to the point where I began hallucinating. At one point I snapped out of a daze, forgot where I was, and tried to fight my way out of bed. The doctor told me it took 6 staff members to restrain me and tie my limbs and forehead to the bed, so they could treat me.

They ended up intubating me, and then putting me on a respirator for two days, which was extremely uncomfortable and painful, and I had to eat through a feeding tube. 

Needless to say I felt like dog shit melting on the sidewalk on a scorching summer day.

My asthma has never been under control....

Since I was 7 I've regularly used a home nebulizer and always keep an emergency inhaler with me. 

I've had pneumonia every single year since I was in the second grade, usually around the same time. 

I've had pneumonia so many fucking times that there have been times I woke up sick, and already knew what it was. 

I've had pneumonia so many fucking times that there have been times where I don't even go to the doctor because I know I could just fight it off, and be good in a week or two, and I'd rather just suffer through it then spend all that money on treatment and hospital visits. 

But this was still by far the worst asthma related experience I ever had, luckily I was released in 4 days (stayed in the hospital Thursday - Sunday.)

Before the incident I had been keeping in shape. Doing Muay Thai, eating healthy, running, but I have still used my inhaler every day, despite my efforts to stay healthy.

After I was released my friend told me about a Joe Rogan podcast episode with a man named James Nestor
https://youtu.be/U5o9b2RVC2E

I laid in bed listening to this episode, the whole thing and my mind was blown. 

The man claims that most breathing problems could be fixed simply by breathing through your nose. Which may sound ridiculous, but made perfect sense to me since I have been a lifelong mouth breather, and have always had problems breathing through my nose. 

After the podcast I immediately bought his book, which I'm still reading (I had to finish another book before I could start - I can't switch mid book that's weird to me).

Here's what's happened so far. 

7 days since I came home from the hospital and started exclusively nose breathing and I haven't used my inhaler or nebulizer once. 

I normally wake up to an asthma attack, it hasn't happened yet. 

I normally wake up in the middle of the night die to sleep apnea, this hasn't happened yet. 

Both of these things despite my doctor telling me it would be a rough week for breathing. 

I'm still in a lot of pain because the tube they shoved down my windpipe was a thick boy, but my breathing feels fine.

Its still too early to tell, but despite all the pain I was in, I could feel a major difference after only 2 days... It's been a week so far and I'm recovering really well.

I have a small dog who we let out into the yard who has done a stellar job keeping most of them away from our house, however, they're still around and she follows her nose to every corner of the yard sniffing them. 

Maybe you know where I'm going with this. I have a pretty bad cat allergy. My asthma has not been stellar recently. It comes and goes in waves but can sometimes really knock me out. Either this is mild covid or long-term complications and diminished lung function from covid (was never formally tested positive but suffered for a month back in March BEFORE moving into the new house) or these feral cats are making me sick. They've never been in the house and really don't come near the door at all as the yard is pretty big, but can it be possible that my dog is dragging their allergens in with her and spreading them to me? And if so, then what? Everyone I've proposed this to thinks I'm crazy, so I'm turning to the only place I can think to turn (at least until my appt to see a pulmonary specialist in OCTOBER, which was their next available).

73,"So when I was like 4 I remember being on an inhaler for allergy induced asthma. My allergies were really bad back then. As I grew older my allergies got a lot better. I don’t think I used the inhaler past like 3rd grade. Then I kinda just forgot about ever having asthma until recently. 

So I’m 22 currently and my roommate was hospitalized for pneumonia and I’ve been very stressed lately but that’s honestly typical for me, I just have anxiety. Lately I’ve been having constant chest discomfort and when I spend time outside in the heat or I exercise I end up really short of breath and often having fits of dry coughing. I thought it was Covid at first so I went and got tested (I still haven’t received any results). On Tuesday I spent a few hours outside wearing a mask because I was around other people and at first it was fine didn’t bother me at all but then towards the end when I walked back to my car to go home, I COULD NOT BREATHE. It hurt so bad I actually loosened my clothes they even felt uncomfortable. I was coughing and wheezing and it took me a good while before I finally caught my breath again. So I went to the doctor on Wednesday. The doctor said my oxygen levels were okay and my respiration rate was at 16. He listened to me breathe through the stethoscope and said it sounded okay, he didn’t think it sounded like I had pneumonia but at this point he wasn’t really sure if it was that, Covid, or even possibly asthma. So he prescribed me benzonatate and said to come back after my Covid test results come in and we can figure out where to go from there. 

I want to know what you guys here think, it might ease my nerves a little. Does this sound like my asthma came back (or that I developed adult onset asthma)? Or do you think it’s something else like pneumonia or Covid?",Asthma,Asthma going away and then coming back? (22 F),1595004324

The social worker at the hospital where she was in the NICU set up a pediatrician appointment and a WIC appointment before we were discharged and the pediatrician appointment is Friday at 3:45pm and WIC is Monday at 11:30am. When we went home the nurse gave us a few samples or bottles or RTF of the formula that she eats. She has to have Elecare specialty formula because she has severe digestive issues and cannot tolerate dairy or certain amino acids. We just ran out completely of the formula that they sent home with and due to my job firing me the day I went into labor prematurely because I had to leave work to rush to hospital. I have Zero money to be able to buy a can because going back and forth to the NICU for 199 days and taking care and supporting my other children wiped me out. I didn't save any money to buy any because the nurse said she thought she sent enough until WIC but NO it wasn't. I had never priced the Elecare formula until today and it is $42.44 PER CAN and I mean just ONE can.  I need to get a can as soon as possible because she has to eat every three hours and I have 41 minutes til it's time. you guys I have asked ally friends and family for help and no one can help. I went to my local social services and talked to a worker about help and she called food banks and things for charity and NO ONE has the Elecare formula. Local churches turned us down and said they had no funds and couldn't help. I have cried all afternoon and night and begged God to send help and idk I am losing hope.

87,"Hi :) So first of all, I don't want anybody to be trying to trigger their asthma on purpose. It can be dangerous, don't do it (I know that might be obvious, but you never know). 

So with that out of the way.. 

I'm lightly asthmatic. I think. Definitely lightly at least. I had an inhaler when I was younger, now I'm 23, no inhaler, no breathing problems, except... sometimes. Sometimes I just loose it and look (and sound) like a dying person. Coughing, wheezing, tight throat full of flem, for about an hour. It has never been life threatening tho. It has never been ""oh shit I really can't breathe"" type of thing, and I'm grateful. Except for me getting sick in the cold really easily.

It's still sometimes a pain in the ass, especially because it's hard to tell what triggers it. It ain't allergies, pollution or pets. It always has to do with me breathing a certain way. I never though about it until today, where I got ""triggered"" after really really high singing to some Celine Dion (yes the titanic one). I finish the song, I do notice that I breathe kinda hard, go onto reddit, find a way too funny of a post, and just start wheezing and coughing all over the place lol.

It's the most random things. Laughing triggers it 25% of the time, exercise about 20%, Wim Hof breathing method about 50%. There are more triggers, I can't think of any atm.

So after todays event, I thought.. I really want to know how to trigger it on purpose. Why? So I KNOW what it is that triggers it, so I can better understand it. What type of breathing.

I looked online, but guess what happens when you type in ""how to trigger your asthma?"" All the sites in the world saying how to prevent it. Or, saying some general stuff like ""watch out for allergies and cats"". 

I want to know how to trigger it on the spot (because I know I can), so that I know what to avoid.

31M, athletic.

**Symptoms (Symptoms are not persistent, varies throughout the day)**

* Chest tightness/pain
* Tightness in the throat
* Sore throat
* Post Nasal Drip
* Strained voice (hard to speak sometimes)

**No stomach cramps or bloating. Energy levels feel normal. No hives, rashes or any itchiness in my mouth or throat.**

Since March, this has been occurring every single day for me. Some days are better than others. I CANNOT pinpoint what's causing this. I've talked with my primary care several times, 2 different GI doctors, and 2 different Allergy doctors. First it was thought to be Acid Reflux then maybe Eosinophilic Esophagitis then possibly Allergies than even something called Oral Allergy Syndrome.

I have allergies to: Dust, Cats/Dogs, Trees (Seasonal). Got tested a few years ago and began allergy shots. Since March, the shots stopped and I missed several months of them. I take Allegra and Montelukast daily.

I have two cats and since March I've been working at home everyday so I've been spending a tremendous amount of time with them. Also, we clean often but maybe the house could be a little more clean?

Been on Omeprazole for 10+ weeks. Has done little to nothing for me. Tried pretty much every antacid there is. No difference.

Made several diet changes. Cut alcohol. Cut coffee for a week. Eating low-to-no acid food. Still no difference.

3,"My wife is a fairly athletic, trim, 41yr old that gave birth naturally three times and could easily run several miles at a respectable pace.

Then in early March she felt this little tickle in her throat.  After a few more days the little tickle turned into a little nuisance cough.  Around this time the whole world was melting down over Coronavirus but we kept ourselves isolated, working from home, being careful.

In April her cough started to include this weird wheezing noise at the end.  Uh oh... got tested, no coronavirus.  Phew!  But the expiratory wheezing was getting worse.

She saw an allergist, although she's never had allergies before.  No allergies detected; go see an ENT!

Saw an ENT, no ENT issues and she was scoped to see if she had signs of gerd: nope.  Go see a pulmonologist!

At this point the wheezing was super intense, she was afraid to do anything because she could so easily be sent into a wheezing fit that ends in a visit to the urgent care clinic.

Late May, she finally saw a pulmonologist who said ""all your symptoms point to gerd which is causing asthma symptoms. Take this Breo inhaler, take 40mg of prilosec every morning, come back to see me in 3 months you'll be fine.""

I have to give a shout-out to Breo; that drug, whatever it does, fixed 90% of her chronic wheezing in a day. Amazing. She still wheezes occasionally but it's no longer keeping her from living her life.

But the problem is she's not getting better, and still has scary wheezing attacks at seemingly random times. One day we'll take a quick walk around the block and she's fine. Another day we'll walk for 20 seconds and she'll start wheezing like crazy. If she watches a sad movie and starts tearing up she'll wheeze like crazy. If she catches a whiff of 4th of july fireworks, wheezefest.

After a month of eating bland food, sleeping propped up, taking prilosec, she's still wheezing a few times an hour, seemingly at random (but never at night, thankfully). Pulmonologist keeps telling us she'll get better eventually but it will take months.

Has anyone seen anything like this? I don't understand how someone could suddenly develop gerd issues so severe they're barely able to function from wheezing yet an ENT didn't see any irritation indicating gerd. How she feels fine laying down (isn't gerd worse when you lay down?) and how it so randomly starts manifesting, like when she gets weepy.

Oh and Albuterol doesn't help.  At all. When she gets a wheezing attack we've tried Albuterol nebulizer treatments, we've tried the rescue inhaler ... all that drug does is spike her heartrate and make her hands shake, it doesn't actually help the expiratory wheezing. Why is her doctor telling her to use it when she has a wheezing episode?

I'm so confused, and just exhausted from searching through Google trying to figure this out. Every time I hear her wheeze I get a knot in my stomach and my eye starts twitching.

4,"Hey guys,

So I’m going to try and keep this short and sweet but I’m not sure if I can actually hold myself to that. Basically I’ve had asthma since I was a kid and it has always been super mild. I would have expired inhalers for over a year before realizing it because I literally never had to use it. Allergy/exercise induced usually so I kept up on allergy meds and stayed away from crazy physical exercise for the most part. 

Fast forward to last June, and I kept having pain in my chest. It mostly felt like muscle pains and just maybe a little pressure on my chest. I could always breathe clearly and never had any wheezing, but I always treated it with a puff off of my inhaler or a half dose of nebulizer albuterol and it would go away. It happened on and off randomly with no real reason from what I could tell. 

Finally got hooked up with a primary care doctor around maybe February(?) and mentioned it and I explained that any time I had gone to an urgent care or anything for it (a few times where it wouldn’t improve with asthma meds) my chest x-rays were clear. I also explained that lately I’ve had to use my albuterol like 2-3 a week due to issues with irritants at work, etc. She took a listen, said my lungs sounded good, but prescribed me Flovent as a preventative anyway. 

2-3 weeks after using it as 2x daily, I was having a horrible hoarse dry cough and my throat constantly felt dry and awful. Called the doctor and explained it, she said I must just have a cold and prescribed cough syrup. I didn’t like that answer (I’m hard-headed) and followed-up with the pharmacist who explained that could very well be a side-effect. Decided to start doing one puff a day in the morning on Flovent. Credit where credit is due, I had to use my albuterol significantly less to the point where my asthma was almost back to the normal I knew. 

Here we are in July. My throat and chest constantly feel more dry than the Sahara and I have a constant feeling of mucus draining down my throat every day. On top of that, I’m having extended periods of heart palpitations and I’ve actually got an arrhythmia going to the point where I have to go see a cardiologist. 

Is this something anyone here has had happen with their Flovent? Is it possible that maybe during non-allergy season (I.e. after the spring wave of pollen) I don’t need to keep using the Flovent? Anyone else had heart issues due to it?

5,"Hi there! 

I [23M] had an inhaler as a child which I stopped using around the age of 12 due to the mildness of my symptoms. Around the start of the pandemic lockdown in my country, with the gyms closing, I decided to look into getting an inhaler to help with running. I’m in fairly good shape, but outdoor running has always been very difficult for me. 

I was prescribed two inhalers by my doctor - a daily Beclometasone inhaler, and a Salbutamol reliever - which really helped with exercise. I went from barely being able to run 500m to running 3k in little over a month. 

Recently, however, I moved house and went about a week without taking my daily inhaler or running. I resumed taking my daily inhaler after about a week, but I’ve had a huge setback with running (back to running only about 500m without stopping, even after about a month of exercising alongside the inhaler). Worse, however, is the fact that my skin has been in terrible condition around my face and mouth since resuming the inhaler. 

Having googled possible explanations for this, the most likely appears to be contact dermatitis brought about by corticosteroid use - has anyone experienced this? I’m not sure whether to continue using my inhaler, or to stop and see if my skin clears. Any advice on this (or from those who have had setbacks with exercise-induced asthma) would be really appreciated.

So I have asthma and cystic fibrosis. Ever since quarantine started I tend to stay indoors but do go outside to do activities safely. So every time I spend more than 3 hours out and about. Usually outdoors my voice starts to change. My throat starts to feel tight and becomes hard to breathe. I then encounter some wheezing. Does this happen to any of you?

My doctor says he thinks this more Athens related and increased my advair but I do not feel a difference. My voice eventually comes back to normal after 3 days or so. It is frustrating.

I’ve gotten an informal list together of the random crap that I *thought* was at least somewhat normal for my whole life up until now. 

* Running out of breath when I talk. (and accidentally sighing because of this)
* Just **not** being able to breathe like a normal person when walking with a purpose of getting somewhere.
* Taking weeks to stop coughing up crap and getting my voice back after a simple cold. 
* *That one time in 2010 when I had a three month long coughing fit. Ahem.* 
* My weird dying goose honk cough from *that one time in 2010* that is still here and often scares people.
* Getting really dizzy and closed up from showers and having to sometimes lay TF down for ten+ minutes afterwards. 
* Feeling like I'm breathing through a wet paper towel when in a very humid climate.
* Cold air *hates* me and cold tasty treats make me cough and always have. Doesn't stop me though.
* Sucking at being able to yawn, and when I **finally** that full breath in a few times a day, it feels incredible and then I get lightheaded and want to sleep. 
* An ache in my chest that's even gone to my back and sternum.
* Deep breathing makes me feel like passing out???
* Deep breaths make me cough or just feel uncomfortable and irritate my lungs.
* Any time after intense workouts like cardio, a raspy breathing sound like Darth Vader got Covid19.
* Laying down is just not worth it sometimes, but I also might pass out soooo.....
* ""Distracting myself"" from the weight on my chest for a few seconds to only feel my body panic and start hyperventilating again, cue the endless cycle.
* Last but not least (ok this one I knew wasn't normal) : Hitting an offered rescue inhaler a few times that wasn't prescribed to me but finding relief from it even though I wasn't able to hit it properly due to just not being able to. (thanks lung capacity)

29,"Asthma Diagnosis: So I’m in my 30s, and the last winters whenever I’ve had a cold I’ve had some trouble breathing. On one occasion I had to get an ambulance, but after some time, rest and some fresh air my breathing improved without medication. After that I had a chat with my doc and she said you probably have asthma, let’s try Ventoline. Before taking any medication she gave me a spirometry test, and we got an x-ray of my chest. Both test were fine, but whenever I get a cold/infection in the airways I get wheezy and breathing is uncomfortable. Like I’m not getting proper air. So her conclusion was adult onset asthma. And I got two inhalers, Ventoline for instant help, and flutide a cortisol for preventing attacks.

Issue #1: So my doc told me to take the flutidide in periods of flairups, and the ventoline for instant relief. But the flutide doesn’t seem to reduce the number of episodes at all. In addition i feel like for me it’s harder to breath in than out whenever these episodes occur, which from what I understand isn’t normal for astmha? And even the ventoline doesn’t magically fix my breathing. So I’ve been looking into Vocal Cord Disfunction as I’ve also had a chronic need to clear my throat 1 million times a day the last 10 years or so. I haven’t discussed VCD with my doc yet. 

Issue #2: I’ve had reflux problems on and off since forever even though I’m fit. From what I’ve read this could be a complication from living with undiagnosed Celiac Disease for 25 years. We’re currently trying acid reducing medicine in case reflux is causing these problems by pushing stomach acid/gas into the lungs. The problem though is that this medicine has so far only prevented reflux, not the problems with breathing or throat clearing. 

So, tbh I don’t understand what’s wrong with me, and it feels like my doc doesn’t either. Does this seem like normal asthma issues to you?

Pollen is low. Humidity is 53%. We are under an official heat warning. 30 degrees. Feels like 36. That’s 86 without humidity, 96.8 with for any Americans who read this. 

Now, I have no fever. No substantial cough. I only cough when I breathe in deep. My throat hurts a fair bit and is tight. I have a headache / pressure in the head that goes down into my jaw/ear area. The area of my chest is tight. The right side of my chest hurts if I take in a deep breath or move around too much but not a constant pain. My eyes hurt. I feel absolutely exhausted. I got about 6 hours of sleep last night, if that matters. My body aches. My heart rate also jacks up randomly (Apple Watch notification)

So last couple weeks my asthma had been bothering me a LOT more than before. Used to be enough to take 2 puffs fluticason in the morning, 2 at night. Now I need my emergency inhaler almost daily (several times a day) and upped my dose of fluticason. 

Since lockdown and working from home my asthma has been getting a lot worse. I went to the doctor today and she asked me if I still had a dog. Apparently that was still in my notes from years before. I don't have one, never had one myself because I'm allergic... , but my family has dogs. Since working from home I've been looking after one sweet and very tiny dog and one sweet and not so tiny dog of my mom (I had the time, so why not?). Turns out that might have been the trigger all along. For some reason I always associate my allergies with just my eczema, but of course they can and do also trigger my asthma. 

So I'm gonna try distancing myself from the dogs now and cleaning my apartment thoroughly. Hopefully it's that simple and it will get better again the next couple of weeks.

I did not think much of it and kept walking, but it got worse and it felt like my airways had shrinked to the size of a straw, and taking deep inhales was very painful and difficult. I kept on walking even though i struggled to breathe, but I truly thought that I would pass out in public. I was wheezing and I was getting sorta dizzy, not to mention I already suffer from social anxiety so chest pains in public is something I already have, making this even more painful. Luckily, when I got on the train and sat down it started fading, but it scared me. Real bad.

23F history of childhood asthma, very mild. 5’7” about 8 stone 7/54kg. 

I had covid in March. Was sick for three weeks and then got a bit better, I remained wheezy since. In the last month it’s gotten worse so I asked my GP for more support and she put me on the brown inhaler which gave me severe palpitations (the blue one has given me palpitations before too). However last week I ended up hospitalized following an ECG where my palpitations were crazy. Normally they’re quite low as I’m a former athlete and usually in good shape but they were skyrocketing and even initially showed an axis block. I was instantly send to the cardiac ward of my local hospital and examined with further ECGs etc. ECGs ended up being normal except for the palpitations at like 115 bpm resting, however they did an x Ray which showed moderate inflammation in my lungs and I was told I have moderate asthma. And that this is natural for someone who’s recently been through covid. 

They said that even though the brown inhaler is probably causing my palpitations, I needed to keep taking it or I wouldn’t be able to breathe properly. I was discharged and sent home despite still having shortness of breath, and spoke with my dad’s friend who was my ENT since childhood, sent them all my test results and she said to stop the brown inhaler and take prednisolone instead as well as Atrovent. However I’m still feeling such shortness of breath,

To the situatio, in short, I am basically still a kiddo(13m) and my mother is an antivaxer. I've had asthma since I was about 6 y/I and my mother decided to use homeopathy instead of ""traditional medicine"" because something with steroids and chemicals which I still don't understand since my mother and her friends are afraid of these ""chemicals"" but won't make a valid reason, which drives me to thinking that it's all bs. Anyway, I haven't used normal medicine from about 4-5 years and my mother could be pretty toxic if she wants to/is in bad mood and wants to get it on others(usually me), but she is constantly working so I don't blame her then much on the second.

So to what's happening right now is that she finally decided to kinda listen to me, after finding that I haven't got my ""medicine"" every day and asked me what do I want to do for my asthma. Since I knew that she will scream in every case and just add stress or whatever is more right in the case, and I just said ""nothing"". She immediately took it as a ""I will figure out how to go to a doctor and I will call an ambulance"" and I actually was kinda relieved, but after that followed another 5 minutes of monologue which were mostly about me being a butthole for not caring about others and other stuff, from which some were probably true, but after the end of it I went to my room and had some of the thoughts which I had few months ago and were mostly ""not good"". Anyway I once have an asthma attack and I constantly can't breathe for a few days, and can't decide should I just wait my mother and her new husband (who is actually pretty cool) are going out of the country in Friday/Saturday and my grandma will be in my city for a few days(she too isn't agreeing with her daughter) plus my dad will take me for summer break and there in any case I will see a doctor, but next few days are going to be pretty harsh if I wait and I am scared that my mother will take my electronics( mostly my PS4 and Nintendo switch, for which I saved money to buy them ) and/or something else I am just too dumb to think about?

**About me:**

42-year-old male with lifelong severe asthma. I'm extremely fit (have competed at master's level cross-fit events). My asthma has been undercontrol for 30+ years. I actually cannot remember the last time I've had the onset of an attack and needed to reach for my rescue inhaler. 

**Medication**:  
250mg Advair twice a day (am and pm)  
Singulair at night  
Ventolin when needed or before long runs  
Avamys nasal steroid spray in the am

**My issue:**

About 2 years ago I did something stupid. I had a bit of a chest cold while on vacation. It's never stopped me from being active so I didn't think much about running in a trail race to the top of Mont-Tremblant in Quebec. It was a mucky, wet and cold run all the way all the way to the top. By the end, I was covered in mud, purple and shivering. I also noticed my breathing was  laboured.

 It was all downhill from there. I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia a week later and put on antibiotics and steroids. I got better fast and was back to the grind shortly after.

I mention this because ever since that sickness about every 2-3 months I begin to have chronic mucus production. It's thick, sort of yellow, foamy and most intense in the mornings. Oh, and there's a lot of it! I've coughed up all kinds of mucus for as long as I can remember but this is by far the most in such a short period. By the afternoon it's retreated into a post-nasal drip that is clear and manageable. I usually let it go for a few months before calling the doctor. In the end, it's antibiotics that seem to clear it up. That is until it comes back after 2-3 months. I've repeated this cycle for 2 years. 

Here's the rub: I have no major asthmatic issues while this is happening. My breathing is excellent. I'm not sneezing and the coughing is only to bring up the mucus. I would totally be fine living with it if it didn't interfere with my morning workouts - I usually need to carry a bucket with me to spit in or I end up being that jogger who is spitting everywhere outdoors. Also, my family thinks it's gross. I do have a slightly sore throat and minor hoarseness (which is why I think it might be reflux). Otherwise, I have no other reflux symptoms. 

**What I've tried to do to fix it:**

My respirologist was convinced that it's just a post-nasal drip that comes and goes with the seasons. My breathing tests are great - but obviously show that I have asthma. Phlegm is part of the condition he says. Allergy medication makes no difference. Either do the seasons.

About 6 months ago, I was able to convince him to let me try a PPI to see if it clears up. It did absolutely nothing.  I used it for about a month before tapering off.

I do daily sinus rinses and gargles with saline solution. No change.

I've elevated my bed as high as my wife will allow it. Nothing.

I've adjusted my diet over the years to combat it with little success. I eat healthy to begin with so it was mostly eliminating caffeine and alcohol which didn't really make a difference other than make me grumpy for missing my morning cup of coffee!

**My next steps:**

I'm going to get a referral to an ENT specialist. I'd love to find out if it is in my sinuses or it actually is LPR.

My last allergy test focused on environmental triggers. It came back with nothing new. I'm hoping to get a food allergy test done next. 

**My questions:** 

Am I missing something here? Could it be allergies? Maybe my asthma is not really in control? Has anyone had a similar experience? What other questions should I ask my doc?

I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 7 or so. Usually, my lungs were pretty okay. For the last year's, I've been taking Brio Ellipta (the stronger one, forgot the dosage). However, in February/March, I got sick. I had throat ache and cough, first dry then wet cough. I never had fever, still did a Corona test and that was negative. All symptoms went away but I was still coughing a LOT.

So, they tested for other things, like pertussis. Nothing. They said, well, maybe it's allergy but apparently my blood results show that it is very unlikely. I still feel like this could be allergy because it's definitely worse outside. But the allergy pills they gave me didn't really help either. Spirometry was always fine, apparently my lungs work well. But, I am still coughing up at least a tea spoon (mostly more than two) of lightly yellow mucus every day! The doctors say I should just wait it out?

I work nights and my companies intentions are for me to return to the 40hrs/ wk I'm contracted to. They've taken all the measures neccissary as far as ppe and hand gel goes.

They have huge extractor fans for filtering air through but the ac wasn't used at all until the very end my shift. I was left with my hands shaking after taking off each mask i replaced for the next and for those brief moments to breath without it.  Is there a case to be made here to return to shielding? This is a fully involved physical standing up job and I spent an hour on foot masked up commuting either way. In an attempt to try and make a case I heard murmurs of case studies suggesting fans and ac once turned off need to be off for a set period of time to avoid potentially circulating covid.

35,"#On Asthma and Death


My ill-health had allowed me a long furlough, when suddenly it resumed the attack.

“What kind of ill-health?” you say.

And you surely have a right to ask; for it is true that no kind is unknown to me.

But I have been consigned, so to speak, to one special ailment. I do not know why I should call it by its Greek name; for it is well enough described as “shortness of breath.” Its attack is of very brief duration, like that of a squall at sea; it usually ends within an hour. Who indeed could breathe his last for long? I have passed through all the ills and dangers of the flesh; but nothing seems to me more troublesome than this. And naturally so; for anything else may be called illness; but this is a sort of continued “last gasp.”

Hence physicians call it “practising how to die.”

For some day the breath will succeed in doing what it has so often essayed. Do you think I am writing this letter in a merry spirit, just because I have escaped? It would be absurd to take delight in such supposed restoration to health, as it would be for a defendant to imagine that he had won his case when he had succeeded in postponing his trial. Yet in the midst of my difficult breathing I never ceased to rest secure in cheerful and brave thoughts.

“What?” I say to myself; “does death so often test me? Let it do so; I myself have for a long time tested death.” “When?” you ask. Before I was born. Death is non-existence, and I know already what that means. What was before me will happen again after me. If there is any suffering in this state, there must have been such suffering also in the past, before we entered the light of day. As a matter of fact, however, we felt no discomfort then. And I ask you, would you not say that one was the greatest of fools who believed that a lamp was worse off when it was extinguished than before it was lighted? We mortals also are lighted and extinguished; the period of suffering comes in between, but on either side there is a deep peace. For, unless I am very much mistaken, my dear Lucilius, we go astray in thinking that death only follows, when in reality it has both preceded us and will in turn follow us. Whatever condition existed before our birth, is death. For what does it matter whether you do not begin at all, or whether you leave off, inasmuch as the result of both these states is non-existence?

I have never ceased to encourage myself with cheering counsels of this kind, silently, of course, since I had not the power to speak; then little by little this shortness of breath, already reduced to a sort of panting, came on at greater intervals, and then slowed down and finally stopped. Even by this time, although the gasping has ceased, the breath does not come and go normally; I still feel a sort of hesitation and delay in breathing. Let it be as it pleases, provided there be no sigh from the soul.[3] Accept this assurance from me – I shall never be frightened when the last hour comes; I am already prepared and do not plan a whole day ahead. But do you praise[4] and imitate the man whom it does not irk to die, though he takes pleasure in living. For what virtue is there in going away when you are thrust out? And yet there is virtue even in this: I am indeed thrust out, but it is as if I were going away willingly. For that reason the wise man can never be thrust out, because that would mean removal from a place which he was unwilling to leave; and the wise man does nothing unwillingly. He escapes necessity, because he wills to do what necessity is about to force upon him.

44,"Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone had experienced this situation before, and could share their experience. I am almost 23 and have had asthma since I was a kid, but didn't get formally diagnosed/treated until 2017. I did pulmonary function tests and was told I had pretty significant asthma, so I was started on Asmanex (mometasone) 220 mcg once daily. 

I guess there was some loss in translation because every time I went to see my doctor, he thought I was on 440 mcg daily, but I was only ever on 220 mcg. He would give me the same ""its a high dose, we should decrease it"" but then when I'd say I was only on 220 mcg, like he told me to take, he'd be like ""oh...ok well I guess that's fine."" That happened for like 2 years, and then he decided to lower me to 110 mcg once daily in April 2019. But when I went to see him yet again he thought I was on 110 mcg 2x daily and I was like...that's what I was on previously! 

Anyways, anytime I drop to 110 mcg daily my symptoms of wheezing/SOB come back, and it does not feel well managed. So after like 2 weeks I told him that and he put me back up to 220 mcg once daily. Fast forward till May 2020, I had a visit and my dr once again said ""this is too high a dose, we should decrease you."" So I went down to 110 mcg once daily like he said, but now my symptoms are worsened again. 

Moral of the story, I want to go back up to 220 mcg once daily but I am now paranoid of keeping flip flopping between the high and low dose because its a corticosteroid and I know they need to be tapered properly. I'm now at a new clinic due to insurance and hoping to be referred to a pulmonologist, but I don't see my PCP for another month and lord knows how long it will take to get referred.

As a young child, I often had to go to the emergency room to calm my asthma attacks; however, as I got older, my asthma became pretty well controlled.

Six months ago, my asthma started becoming less controlled. I thought it was perhaps because I was overweight, so I lost over 20lbs, but my asthma is still getting worse. It is now to the point where it is no longer controlled and is reaching severe levels.

I’ve been meeting with my allergist weekly to try and get my asthma under control again. My Advair has been doubled and was switched from a discus to a HFA so I can take less sharp breaths to receive the medication, my allergy shots have resumed (they were paused in March due to COVID), and I was recently prescribed Budesonide to use in my nebulizer daily (I hate prednisone because it increased my anxiety, so this was an alternative). My doctor has also been trying to convince me to start getting Xolair injections, which cost over $2,000/month.

It started out being just when I was laying down, but soon progressed to all day long, every day. I went to the ER multiple times during November 2019-Jan 2020, but each time everything came back normal. Good EKG, good Chest X-Ray, etc. I saw an urgent care who thought I had adult onset asthma, and gave me an albuterol inhaler. Sadly, the albuterol does little to nothing to help me. I saw a pulmonologist in January, who gave me a spirometry test. The spirometry graph came back slightly abnormal, the bottom side of the curve was not egg shaped but more flattened. He did not think it was asthma, and gave me some PPIs and carafate and directed me away.

My trouble has persisted until now. I've been on the PPIs (pantoprazole) and carafate since January but they haven't helped any. I am seeing a GI doctor now, and have more recently been getting more traditional symptoms of GERD like belching and regurgitation, so am undergoing tests with him.

73,"Today I decided to go on an outing for the first time in over three months (short grocery trips notwithstanding.) I took a 10 minute walk from my home to the regional train, took the train downtown. I then walked about 35 city blocks from the train to my destination (my favorite thrift shop). It was about 90 degrees out. I did not have my mask on for this portion of the trip, opting to socially distance from others while outdoors. Mask was on during any indoor trips and on the train.  


About 3/4ths of the way to my destination I began to feel short of breath and fatigued. I felt my heart rate was highly accelerated despite not intense physical output.Though it was hot and I was walking, I drank two small bottles of water during my walk and I was not going at an excessive speed. I thought perhaps the heat was getting to me, so I went into a convenience store and got a small bottle of diet tea. (I also used the restroom briefly.) I walked the rest of the way to my destination.  


While inside I really was struggling to breathe. Literally shopping was giving me shortness of breath. Being stubborn, I ignored it, but when I went down the short flight of stairs from the 2nd to 1st floor it was like I'd run a marathon. I checked out, and then called an Uber home. The wait for the Uber was agony. I asked a stranger walking by if they had a bottle of water they would sell me, I must have looked a fright because they gave me a fancy seltzer they'd just bought from Whole Foods.  


I had to beg the driver to pull over and let me run into 7-11 to get yet more water. The ride home was agony and the driver expressed concerns for me. By the time we made it to my house (roughly 30 minutes) I honestly felt like I was going to die if I didn't lay down immediately. I got into my bedroom, turned the A/C down to 65, stripped naked and passed out in bed for four hours. Before I did, I took my temperature and it was normal.

Now that I'm awake again, I feel a slight tightness/discomfort in my upper chest and throat. I can breathe mostly normally, though that area feels compressed. There is some fluid buildup but it is very mild.

81,"Still trying to deal with this COVID19 anxiety.  I guess for me it tends to be a bit more personal. I mean, the trauma of my childhood, the source of my diagnosed PTSD, revolves around asthma.  Endless nights spent fighting for breath; being afraid to fall asleep due to asthma; being intubated three times, two of which I can remember with shocking clarity; outright dependency on corticosteroids,  and the fun house that brings with it...all of that weighs on the formative psyche.
And then, having such well-controlled asthma for the past 20-30 years.  I mean, asthma, as it stands, is kind of a non-issue, these days.  It doesn't bother me much at all.  And I am no longer ""used to"" the struggle when I have an attack.  I'm not even considered high-risk, anymore!
And here comes COVID19.  I know, rationally, that I am no more susceptible to catching it than other people.  I know that there really isn't any objective reason to think that I would be in the 20% of infected who would experience severe symptoms.  And yet, I feel like my life is hanging in the balance.  Every time I go out is nerve-wracking.  Every cough has me wondering what my SPO2 is looking like...and my peak flows are consistently in the 750 range!  FYI, that's probably a better FEV1 than you, gentle reader, can produce on a PF meter.
I'm a nervous wreck, and my response to this whole situation seems to be completely out of my control.  The words ""don't worry"" have no effect on me.  
So my response is this:  I will wear a mask in enclosed public spaces.  I will wash my hands frequently.   I will stay away from other people as much as reasonably possible.  And, well, until a vaccine comes out, that's all I can do.  And, BTW, I WILL be taking the vaccine when it comes out.  It's not even a question.  Seriously, save your breath.

It fights against viral, microbial, fungal, and bacterial threats and has anti-histamine properties.

I bought some with hopes that it would really help my allergies but was curious if it would affect my asthma.

During exercise I have always struggled with getting enough air in, and it always seems to be the limiting factor for me, even when I feel like my heart can handle more. Despite playing sports and training for a dualthon, this has remained an issue for me. The limiting effect of my breathing is more tolerable if I breathe through my nose and keep my heart rate relatively low. However, whenever I start breathing through my mouth, I start to get a tightness in the chest and coughing, especially in the winter time. Sometimes, I get out of breath carrying or lifting something up as well. It's a strange feeling because I know I shouldn't be getting out of breath for pouring soap into my soap dispenser. Another example from a few years back is walking up a small hill left me breathless and unable to talk. The friend I was with asked if I was okay and looked a little shook. 

Also, I have noticed I frequently get a burning feeling in my chest, cough, and acid reflux when I run. I also have GERD and occasional issues swallowing. I went for an endoscopy, but it was negative.

2,"I just stumbled upon this sub and wanted to share my experience with you all. I've suffered with chronic asthma since childhood till recently (I'm in my early forties now). Since last one year, I've been practising a very simple yogic practice with which I was able to almost got rid of my asthma problem. The yogic practice is called Kunjal Kriya / Gajakarani Kriya / Water Induced Vomiting. You can check google / youtube for how this should be done, there is a lot of information about the procedure. This has been prescribed in vedic texts such as Gheranda Samhita several thousands of years ago and it's not at all new practice.


Basically you need to do this on an empty stomach as soon as you get up in the morning (Don't have any tea / coffee / milk etc). You need to drink lukewarm water (make sure water is just only a little bit warm and not too hot so that you don't burn your toungue). You need to take about close to 6-7 glasses of water rapidly (Drinking should be finished in max 5 mins). You need to take water until you feel that it's no longer possible to drink any further. While drinking the water you may notice that you might burp a lot or sweat, but it's okay. Then all the water you just drank, needs to be vomited out. The idea of vomiting might sound gross / disgusting, but beleive me, the benefits of practicing this method far outweigh the suffering with asthma. If you carefully see it's kind of internal cleansing with water. More over you not taking any unknown liquid, it's just luke warm water.


Once you finish drinking water, in standing position bend forward so that your legs and rest of the body make around 90 degrees. Open your mouth wide enough and bring your toungue out and it bends downwards i.e., towards your chin. This action itself might cause vomiting depending on how much water you drank. While in a bending position start exhaling air out with your mouth by making the sound of haaa, for a minute or two. Then slowly slide your index fingure and middle fingure deep into the inside of your mouth towards the base of your tongue. If you visualize, your fingers are completely inside your mouth touching the upper surface of toungue. Slowly start massaging the posterior part of the toungue while continuing to exhale. As you do it, you would start vomiting bursts of water you just drank. All the water might not come out in a single go. While you vomit the water, take out your hand. Breathe for some time, once you are stabilized, continue to massage your toungue again so that you could vomit rest of the water. In order to vomit out the water completely, you might need to continue messaging the base of toungue for about 5-10 minutes in 4-6 phases. Initially you might feel the whole thing to be nasty and totally disgusting, but as you practice it for about a week to 10 days, you would start seeing the results.


I was a chronic asthma patient myself and used inhalers that give temporary relief only for some time. But, soon after I started this practice I've seen excellent results. I'm not saying I've completely got rid of asthma, I do get the symptoms now but very very rarely, maybe once a month (that too when I have very bad food like too much sugar, oily / spicy foods, cold items etc). I'm giving some links below when you get more details on this practice. For regular non-asthamtic individuals too, this practice gives a lot of benefits and gets rid of acidity, gastric troubles, constipation, indestion related headaches etc.

Important note on who should NOT do this:

1. If you are too young (below 15 years) or too old (above 60), do not try this.

2. Pregnant ladies strictly avoid this practice.

3. people who had any surgeries recently, mainly heart surgery, shouldn't do this. Vomiting might cause adverse affects and make the stitches open up leading to complications, so please do not try this in such cases.

4. If you have any other ongoing severe medical conditions, pls consult your doctor before trying this.",Asthma,Kunjala Kriya (Yoga Technique for controlling Asthma ),1593193411

Took me three weeks to be back to feeling “not sick” and maybe another month of noticing I felt weak. I had pains in the back of my lungs when breathing deeply for a month, but no extra tightness/shortness of breath. 

I’m still not back to full fitness/strength but I’m at a level which i consider back to a normal ish level  (I tried to carry an armchair up three flights of stairs and failed, but I can walk 10k and do all normal activities)

The only lingering symptoms now are arthritis-like pains in my toes (weird I know!) and the occasional strangeness with my sense of taste, which I lost entirely.

7,"Woke up this morning at 5 gasping for breath. At first I tried to tell myself it was anxiety but I was deep breathing, felt the chest retractions, my lungs were on fire. I dont ever remember feeling that bad but I know I've spent nights in the hospital as a toddler for asthma so maybe then. When I saw it getting worse I quickly jumped on my nebulizer. I guess at that point I started panicking, too. I called my mom 5 times before she finally picked up (we live together) and that just added on to the panicking. I was so afraid I wasnt gonna be able to breathe anymore soon. 

A treatment helped but I still feel a bit bad. My mom had me come sit with her, gave me her oxygen on low for a bit and her pulse ox. Unfortunately she seems largely convinced it was mostly anxiety (and my 02 strengthened that because it was around 94 even though im usually 97-98) but I think it was mostly asthma. Like I said, I've never felt so bad. I know how my anxiety is and im sure it played a part in it! But this was different, this was worse. I usually breathe fast when im anxious but today I was gasping for breath, breathing slow and deep. 

I've been sick for a month with symptom severity waxing and waning. Mostly SOB, cough and chest pains. Over the past few days days the pain was really bad so I ended up in the ER twice because I was advised to do so but both times they said everything looked okay and so it was probably just bronchitis and asthma. Because of that I really didn't wanna call the ambulance for this cause I literally just got home from an ER like 4 hours ago. Im trying to wait for my heart rate to go down and stuff, maybe do another treatment since my lungs still burn. I dont know, im lowkey freaked though. 

How do you stay calm in a situation like that? Does anything besides albuterol help (drinking water or tea/head elevation/ etc)?

10,"So I haven’t been completely tested positive yet but I’m 100% sure I have it. My mom was tested positive and I have all the regular symptoms including body aches, fevers, coughing, headaches, major eye soreness, and starting to slightly lose my sense of smell.  It’s a biiitch to deal with right now.

I can say in all honesty, my inhaler has been helping me AMAZINGLY with getting all the phlegm from my lungs out. One pump and I’m coughing for a good 30 minutes getting it al out. That’s the best thing to do so it doesn’t develop into anything worrying. Overall I’m feeling okay, I just feel super winded (even more than usual) when doing anything. Happily the body aches are passing kinda quickly, headache is doing better, the only things I’m dealing with are fever, sweats, chills, and a hell of a lot of phlegm. The inhaler really does work so well with the lung situation though. Helps me get it out but also helps me when I feel extra winded or short of breath.

I’m just hoping no one is neglecting the use of any inhalers because its been a huge life saver for me and if you also have it or something similar keep using it as needed bc I’m hoping it’ll help keep it developing into something like pneumonia or something. Hope everyone is staying safe! If you can’t use a mask like me, please just stay home.

I know losing weight will help and I’ve fix my diet. I eat once a day and that meal is balanced. I do have a small little pot of fruit in the morning when I’m working but that’s about it. I don’t get hungry much.

Anyway I’m asking because I’m wondering if I should go back to the doc and check more. I workout and run a lot with no issues and have read sometimes it cones back as it doesn’t really go away?

45,Hey so my doctor is thinking of prescribing me Dupixent for my asthma. I was wondering if anyone in here had used it and what your experience was,Asthma,Dupixent,1592861447
46,"The Doctor never gave me much info. So I'm hoping I can get more info here.

&amp;#x200B;

I use to cough in spring time and would take symbicort for the pollen. And it will go away immediately. (taking symbicort 200)

I do have allergy for dust mite too, but it doesn't really make me cough that much.

&amp;#x200B;

Last Oct. I caught a bad virus. After the virus was gone, I was still coughing with a lot of mucus. I swim a lot but it was hindering my swim greatly at that time. So the doc told me to use symbicort even though it's not pollen season. After a week I was back to normal and can swim again. The doc told me I have chronic bronchitis, I should take it everyday.

Anyways I keep taking symbicort until May 2020, where I started coughing suddenly. The doctor has no idea why. Did chest xray (nothing showing) and he listened to my lung, nothing. He also said I dont have chronic bronachitis and that he doesnt know why he diagnosed me with it before.

I went to another doctor and he prescribe me with Advair HFA, told me symbicort powder might be irritating me. I switched to that. The coughing seem to have been better/stopped but

my condition was been very unstable, sometimes breathing feel weird to me, sometimes i feel completely fine being in the same place doing the same thing. And when i have that weird problem it doesn't like I need more air. It just doesnt feel ""good"" breathing sometimes. The air going into my nose feel cold too sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

The interesting thing is usually when i go out, I feel fine and good. I played tennis on a hot day, feel fine, Went to a park all day and ran a bit, feel fine. Worked on my car in a dusty garage, feel fine. So I dont think pollen is causing me this problem. I suspected it might be AC, but I also had that weird problem when AC is off.

&amp;#x200B;

I suspected it might be anxiety but I can be feeling happy, and worry-free and the breathing problem can kick in suddenly.

&amp;#x200B;

the week and a half prior to last Wed, I feel fine, just sometimes that breathing problem, but very minor doesnt bother me at all. However after last Wed. I ran out of AdvairHFA. And stopped taking it. for the first two days I feel completely fine and normal. Then I had a few coughs at night, (i am guess the pollen or dust) so I started taking symbicort for a day. But that didnt get rid of the cough but no breathing problem either, so I switched back to advair and next morning, breathing problem came back I had to use the recuse puffer once, the cough is gone though.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:

1. Could advair HFA be causing this breathing issue? And symbicort didnt help the cough cause I didnt take it long enough recently (but then beginning of May I was coughing even though i was constantly taking symbicort)
2. Is this asthma? If so what could be causing it? and how serious and life threatening is this? I read online a lot of people die from asthma (so far I have taken the reuse puffer 2-3 times in the last 2 months)
3. Could this be multiple things combined together to create this? I also stopped swimming since pandemic so my lung probably not as good as before. Can this be temporary, and I will be normal again?

&amp;#x200B;

I know it might be impossible to answer these, but can someone at least advise me on what I can do to test/pinpoint what issue I am having?

I cant for the life of me pinpoint what is going on with me. This is extremely stressful and scary for me. Having asthma sound very scary too.

78,"Hey all, I was diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma 14 years ago (I'm 29F), but I remember having symptoms as early as 7.

My ""attacks"" (quotes b.c I'm not entirely confident in my diagnosis), only occur from vigorous, extended exercise. Essentially, I start to feel my lower throat constrict causing me to wheeze. If I don't stop moving, my throat constricts further with each breath. Within 5-10 breaths, literally zero air can get through. Usually I stop what I'm doing completely before it gets to this point, but it often escalates there either way. I go into tunnel-vision panic survival mode. Once I stop moving completely, I have to focus 100% on calming down so my airway can loosen up. Usually, airflow is 90% restored in under 30 seconds. I can continue to exercise, but another attack will almost certainly happen within 10 minutes. I do not have any coughing, except a brief dry cough, or mucus coming up. Albuterol before exercise lengthens the amount of time before I have an attack, but rarely prevents it. 

Oddly, when I moved away from a humid area (Maryland) to an extremely dry area (Utah) when I was 22 the ""attacks"" largely stopped! Although I had been trying to run 3 miles consecutively for years, I wasn't able to do it the first time until I moved to Utah - within the first 2 months, no-less.

So starting way back in late March/Early April I began having chest tightness. No runny nose, congestion or itchy eyes. This happened at the same time as I began working at home everyday. Before I would go to the office 5 days a week. A well ventilated and clean office. I live with two cats and i guess we could be a little more dust free?

At first, my Primary and GI doc believed it to be Acid Reflux. Due to COVID, I couldn’t and still cannot get any tests done to confirm that. They did put me on Prilosec (40mg) and after about 4 weeks the chest tightness kinda went away. But in its place, I started having some bad throat tightness pretty much daily.

Diet is pretty clean. It mostly non-acidic food. Made several adjusts to do that. Pretty in shape physically as well.

I have Allergic Asthma. Diagnosed a few years ago after i got these two cats. The allergist did some tests and found out i’m allergic to dogs/cats, dust mites and a whole bunch of seasonal allergies including pollen. So a few years back they started me on some allergy shots to tame this. Since COVID began, I have not had an Allergy shot since they closed the office. I do take montelukast, claritin and Nasacort daily though.

Another call with my Primary and he now believes it to be allergies since i’m home all day with cats and dust that i’m allergic to and on top of that, a pretty bad season of pollen.

Is this allergies? Allergic Asthma? I’m surrounded by triggers all day and the lack of allergy shots is making me and my Primary think that to.

24,"Basically, I've always had moderate asthma. I was born in Greece with lung complications, and was put on steroids to help my lungs develop right after birth. In Greece, my mum never told me much about my asthma other than taking the blue inhaler when I felt something coming on. I've only ever had one proper full blown asthma attack, when I was around 10yrs old, and since then I've only ever had mild-moderate wheezing instead of proper chest tightening asthma attacks.
At age 12, we move to the UK for many reasons, and my asthma gets a little better outside because of less pollen/etc, but also gets worse because British housing has so much carpeting and we have dogs, that I’m allergic to.

Cut to last year, I go to university and my asthma gets so much better since I'm away from my dogs, and all is well. Then in March, last year, I caught the flu and it absolutely destroyed my lungs- I had to go get some prescribed prednisone and even then, for about a week, I couldn't get a full breath of air. 
Since then, my asthma has gone back to levels that it was at home, despite not being around my allergies, and I went to the clinic and got a preventer inhaler prescription. The odd thing is, I didn't even realise that pre-university, my asthma was badly controlled. I thought it was normally to need the reliever, blue inhaler once or twice a day??
During highschool, every time I walked home, I would get home and wheeze like crazy, barely getting any air, until I got my blue inhaler out, and somehow, I was like ""this is fine, just super inconvenient"" which is so dumb!! 

Even after getting prescribed the preventer inhaler, I still need my blue inhaler daily. I’ve gotten told off by my clinic again that I shouldn’t be at the point where I need the blue inhaler daily, so they’ve upped my preventer inhaler prescription, so that’s how it is now.

I find the concept that badly controlled = needing it more than 3 times a week, so weird since that was my life for 18yrs, and was never told how unhealthy that is and probably how much damage my lungs have suffered. So I'm having trouble controlling my asthma, because to me it seems fine to need the reliever very often, and don't often contact my clinic when the frequency of it increases.

I have been having bout of breathing issues for the last 2 weeks. What happens is if I cough (even once) one side of my chest feels very constricted. I have gone to the doctors and they have prescribed prednisolone (7 days up to day 5 / 6x 5mg every morning) which doesn't really help. My asthma had been under control for years (literally since I was 7) and I find it very strange that I am now suddenly struggling to breathe. I feel like one side of my chest is tight and I have cough to clear my throat but not really comes up. I take symbicort daily (2 puffs per day... Buy this has been upped to 4 puffs per day) 

As you can imagine these bouts are quick scary but also very annoying as when I have them I struggle to talk but when I don't I'm fine.

1. Can allergies just effect the chest 
2. Can I expect the prednislone to work
3. How can I get relief? (I currently take ventolin but again doesn't work well)

My school has an option where we can provide medical documentation and support for a single.

March/April, 2 more incidents waking up with a hot flash coughing, wheezing, the second time it was really bad so I called a tele-health doctor, diagnosed as asthma and got a rescue inhaler. 

Now a couple months later, its been about a week and I've had to use the rescue inhaler every night/morning which was telling me something is wrong, so I called the tele-health doctor again, this time was prescribed Prednisone 20mg, 2 tablets every morning for 5 days. I'm a little worried because I have pretty severe psoriasis, which I read this on the National Psoriasis Foundation Website --   ""At some point, your general practitioner may prescribe prednisone for reasons other than psoriasis, such as to combat an allergic reaction. However, Blauvelt warns people with psoriasis to be careful about using oral or injectable steroids. 'These drugs should be used by psoriasis patients only when absolutely necessary. Long-term use of oral or injectable steroids tends to make psoriasis more volatile over time."" 

I'm assuming 5 days doesn't count as ""long-term use"", but still.

I was also told to buy a cool-mist humidifier and use it when I go to bed which I just bought. I'm really hoping this all works because the sudden onset of it seeming to get progressively worse was a little frightening, and I'm not exactly sure what the game plan is after the 5 days of Prednisone if it still continues.

It all started back about a year ago when I was training to do a 10km run. I started being short of breath. Went to see my doctor who prescribed symbicort and figured I probably had season allergies. Helped a lot, but I rarely took it after. Fast forward to January and I get bronchitis (my daughter gets it too). Just wipes me out. Since then, I've had on and off chest tightness, occasional slightly sore throat, wheezing, and sometimes phleghm that sits in my throat causing me to try to cough it up (unsuccessfully). I'm taking the Symbicort daily. I went to an allergist and got diagnosed with dog allergies (I have 2 dogs) and something called nasal polyps which is apparently related to allergies/asthma. Ten days of predisone cleared that up. Also taking a nasal steroid spray to prevent it from coming back, but I kinda suspect it is. Also should note I smoked about half a pack a day for \~14 years (now am 35) but don't smoke any more. I had a chest X-ray done a couple months ago that was normal. I'm a little overweight (BMI of 28.5 but I have a generally big build). I can still exercise just fine with the Symbicort; regularly biking \~80-100km/week without issue.

I guess the issue is I still have chest tightness and my chest doesn't quite feel right. The phleghm is a huge annoyance too. I'm all paranoid and worried I'm gonna die and I suspect that level of stress is causing some tiredness/depression symptoms.

96,"I'm cross posting this, as I should have posted here to begin with...

I'm a 40 y/o healthy, active, fit, female.  I have suffered from sports induced asthma since I was 13.  However, my ""asthma"" has NEVER responded to inhalers, and it has held me back my entire life.  I'm an avid cyclist, but I only ride alone because any long hill has the ability to create extremely tight and painful chest as well as difficulty breathing.  So I need to be able to stop suddenly to prevent this from getting out of hand.  I have also NEVER experienced any asthma symptoms outside of exercise. Until...

2.5 months ago, I started noticing my breathing seemed off.  Felt like a weird feeling in my throat upon exhale... and a heavy chest.  Some dry coughing.  All primarily at night.  It kind of felt like the tale of of how pneumonia has felt in the past.  This happened kind of over night.  This went on for a month and then I decided to see a doctor in case I had covid without any other covid symptoms (I had zero other symptoms).  Went to Urgent care, they tested me... came back negative.  He thought I might have pneumonia and he gave me 7 days on antibiotics.  No improvement.  I returned to Urgent care. I got a chest x-ray.  Came back clear.  He decided to put me on Symbicort 200 turbuhaler.  Suddenly... I get a little worse.  So 1 day on symbicort and my chest feels kind of congested.  Though I'm only dry coughing at night.  This increases on the symbicort.  After a few days, I stopped taking it.  The chest congestion kind of improved a little, but it remained there (where it wasn't before the symbicort - it just felt tight before). 

I made and appointment with a GP doctor.  She tells me to start taking it again, claiming it won't hurt, but might help.  And she refers me to a respirologist.  This makes no sense... I told her it made me feel worse!  So ""won't hurt?""  Okay?  I start taking it again as directed... it worsens things.  So I stop.  

I have my appointment with the respireologist.  He wants me to UP my dose!  Go from 1 puff twice a day... to the max of 4, twice a day.  I tell him this makes me feel worse... but he says to do it.  I try it.... I feel way worse now.  Flem... dry throat... can't exercise without feeling like I'm choking on my saliva.  I tried staying on it, but I just feel even worse on it.  He also said that if things got worse he was also going to put me on salbutural (has never worked for me in the past) and prednisone. I'm sure he's going to give me grief for stopping the symbicort when I call to tell him.  But I feel worse on it!

I don't understand... I've been non-responsive to asthma medication... or had negative side effects.  Why in the world would he pile on so many medications that aren't working like this?  I'm at a loss because I need help, and he's the respirologist!  It's been 2.5 months and I'm not improving.  At all.  I don't feel like it's asthma.  I mean it came on overnight and hasn't gone away for one single day.  If it is asthma... why so sudden?  My only thinking is that maybe I did have covid at some point and it caused this?  (I live in Canada, we don't have antibody testing).

My symptoms when this started in April, used to only be at night. Now i feel them all day.  Still worse at night. 

Anybody experience anything like this with covid?  Having no symptoms but asthmatic symptoms... and for months?

And the Symbicort... why would he not only tell me to continue taking it despite making me feel worse (which doesn't go away now, only lessens without the Symbicort)... but he wants me to go for 2 puffs a day to 8??  Then if it gets worse... salbutural... and prednisone?  But the symbicort is why it has gotten worse!

Sorry... I'm so frustrated and scared... and getting really depressed to be honest.  I just want to understand what is happening and not just be pounded with a bunch of drugs without being heard.",Asthma,Asthma? Something else? Covid?,1591604580

98,"I haven’t had a serious asthma attack in over ten years but yesterday I had a horrible experience. I was out of town with my fiancé and his family, about 25 mins from home and didn’t think to bring an inhaler because it didn’t fit in my purse and I normally keep it in my jacket pocket which I wasn’t wearing. Anyway, throughout the day with all the laughing, alcohol, and ice cream, I felt my airways becoming more and more constricted. The last hour I felt like I was breathing through a straw and you could barely hear wheezing because my airways were so tight. We FINALLY left (his parents like to sit around at restaurants for hours) and my fiancé and I were in the front seat with the parents in the back. With a 25 minute drive ahead I still could barely breathe so I tried my best to sit up straight and do breathing techniques. I didn’t want to make a scene because I am not the type but I was just crying on the way home quietly and my fiancé knew and was driving fast and doing his best to get me home all day. Anyway if we were any further I would have had to go to the hospital, learn from me, ALWAYS bring an inhaler.",Asthma,I had my first serious asthma experience in over ten years yesterday,1591600214
99,"My work re opened this week and 3 of 3 days I’ve been able to hold myself together long enough to at least have my panic attacks in the car on the way home or in the shower after I get home. At least I think it’s panic... or anxiety from wearing the mask for 8 hrs. I don’t know that I’ve ever really had that before, so idk what it is but it is emotionally exhausting. I’ve also been having blurry vision which can be a side effect of prednisone although I am almost done with the week long cycle.

I was diagnosed with asthma about 3 years ago and it used to only be bad when fall/winter hit. Feels like I’m breathing through a clogged filter, my lungs are heavy, itchy as hell and my body starts this non stop dry cough (I think in response to “scratch the itch” but it’s not even “scratching” my lungs just my throat). Not a single drop of phlegm ever comes up even when it sometimes feels like there’s something that might possibly come up. I’ve been on advair diskus for those 3 years, along with an albuterol rescue inhaler. When I got my new Dr, about 1 yr ago he added an acid reflux/heartburn medicine. These past few months the itching and coughing is super out of control, not to where I’ve had to go to the ER but definitely worse than normal, especially for this time of year. I talked to my dr last week and he added a week cycle of prednisone, refilled my rescue inhaler and gave me tessalon perles. I haven’t noticed a change for the better. He did also refer me to an allergy specialist to try and pinpoint it, but that’s booked out for a couple more weeks. 

Nothing feels like it is working so far, I’ve been having blurry vision which I read is a prednisone side effect, that worries me some. I also worry about the anxiety and having to wear these masks while working. My work can be pretty busy and I am very active when I have a lot of clients. I used to be able to shove some Vick’s up my nose and it would soothe the “itching” for awhile (usually at night so I could fall asleep). Now that doesn’t even work. I’ve been falling asleep sitting up against my pillows on the wall along my bed. 

I am at a complete loss on what to do, I did email my Dr asking about a medical leave to allow tome to get this under control because then maybe I could adjust to wearing a mask at work if I didn’t feel like I was suffocating all day, but it was Friday when I emailed and haven’t heard back. Hopefully tomorrow!

I have some mild/serious gut allergies, but not lung allergies.  I’m not sure what spurs the control, but usually if I eat a fatty fish when things are going wrong I gain some ability to grab onto my lungs and have control.  A lot of thing seem to relax with it, like palette tension/jaw tension too.  And once I finally seem to find them and relax, it’s honestly what I assume a patient with new lungs feels like, but they feel it 10 times harder.  Just pure control and...you just feel so, so much more relaxed and in control. But sometimes they can go out of view and I have to figure out this body equation to relax them, if I can.  Have good diaphragm form, but it’s my literal lungs and their empty space that seem to come into view, which makes normal nose breathing way easier and vivid.

The relaxation is insane.  So I’m wondering what’s up.  Weird thing is, it started up a few weeks ago after getting a huge dose of bread I thought was gluten free.

4,"Hello fellow asthma warriors,

I just signed up to reddit for the purpose of this amazing online forum. Like many previous people have posted, I likely had COVID-19 that I picked up from my pilot husband. While the actual COVID experience seemed “minor”, my current asthma symptoms have been the worse since I was a teen  (I’m in my mid 30s now). In fact, I didn’t believe that this was actually asthma - I thought it was COVID lingering for WEEKS (like Over 6 weeks!) until I talked with my doctor who realized I was having asthma (he called it reactive airway disease/asthma reacting from the virus) based off my difficulty breathing out, tight and itchy chest and groaning/rattling in my chest. Before this, I used my ventolin maybe once a month or less when I was around animals - to now taking it frequently throughout the day.   

Anyway, since I was talking ventolin so much - the doctor started me on Singulair (or rather generic Singulair) and I am taking 132mg of Flovent 2x a day (44mg - 3 puffs in morning and night). It took a rollercoaster of 3 weeks on both for me to notice ANY difference - but I did let my asthma go on for too long (several weeks) before treating it (because I couldn’t believe it was asthma).  Some days are still worse then others and this groaning/rattling remains even though my breathing is overall better  - but not where I was before by close. 

Okay sorry for a long post - but my question is two part: 1) How long does an asthma exacerbation last/when will the Flovent and Singulair get me back to normal? and 2) I’m all about trying complimentary medication routes - I’ve been taking vitamin C, vitamin D, magnesium and fish oil which I believe have helped. I just bought some high quality/full-spectrum CBD oil and I’m wondering if others have tried CBD oil for their asthma? And what was your experience with it?

7,"So over the past month or so I switched from smoking to vaping, slowly at the end of every day I would get a bit of shortness of breath, the beginning was just like a dry throat feeling, not too bad. But it got progressively worse and worse until this last week, I was having chest pains, coughing attacks and some pretty bad shortness of breath. Usually about 2 hours after vaping. I went to the hospital on the 4th day of this, they did all the tests, ekg, ct scan, bloodwork, they found that there was nothing wrong with me and I was healthy.

So when I got home I figured meh I guess im fine and it is getting better so I vaped again, thats when it happened all over again except this time the shortness of breath was worse.

Back in March I had a cough which quickly morphed into a productive cough and chest heaviness. It went on for 5 week hacking up yellow phlegm before I was prescribed antibiotics for walking pnemonia over the phone. 

I finished the antibiotics in mid April and was having bouts of chest tightness, chest pain on the left side especially on deep inhaling, thinking consciously  about my breathing, low grade fever of 37.3 - 37.7.

I have a cardiac history so I'm already cautious when taking albuterol because of increased heart rate and palpitations.  I also get extremely shaky with each dose.

35,So my asthma has been under control for a while. I actually think any shortness of breath I’ve been having lately is stemming from acid reflux and GERD. I talked to my physician who said I can go off my steroid inhaler. I’m only on 50 mcg a day so not the highest dose. Well she told me to start with every other day and than every two days and so fourth until the inhaler was empty. I told her ever since I started the inhaler I’ve noticed extreme bone pain and felt like I always had a cold. Either way I wanted to go off of it because my asthma has been under control since I’ve gotten control over my allergies. I’m only a week in and I really didn’t think I would have any side effects but today I was extremely tired had joint pain and dizzy and I couldn’t put it down to anything until I read of coarse on google these steroids can cause withdrawal symptoms.

I went to the hospital to drop off the forms, and printed out information for my doctor to read in regard to what type of language to use when filling out the documents and writing the support letter. She didn't really use any of the language and her support letter did not follow the outline I had included. It just stated I had asthma and allergy. It made me a bit upset that my doctor didn't bother to read the guidelines.

In order to make up for my doctor's one-sentence replies to questions that did not include the intended language and explanations as to how these accommodations relate to my disease, I had to write my own explanations along with her documentation. I was able to get everything but the single-occupancy room which I was more concerned about. Being with a roommate who doesn't respect my triggers and irritants, who doesn't social distance or can put me at potential risk makes me upset. 

I contacted her asking for another support letter with reasons why I need a single, and she rejected me and said she already wrote one. Her letter was three sentences and it did not explain any of why I need the accommodations I am requesting.

50,"Female, early 20s

Had severe anxiety since age 12 and panic attacks since age 18.

I woke up this morning feeling like I couldn't hardly breath. My upper chest felt tight, I was producing large amounts of mucus (I've had postnasal drip and chronic sinus infections since I was a baby), and I had pain and popping of my ribcage in the center of my chest just right of my left breast (this popping occurs almost daily; it feels like a part of my rib is caught/stuck on muscle or tissue, and I have to keep moving around until it pops, but pain there tends to stay for about 30 minutes afterward).

I was so worried I would suffocate and die. I thought it was asthma, but I had no wheezing, and the symptoms would sort of come and go (or more like, get better then get really, really bad then get a little better again).

This episode lasted from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. I'm feeling mostly okay now that I took multiple over-the-counter allergy medicines. However, I'm not sure if  I should just write this off as anxiety or allergies and just move on with my day or go to the doctor.

64,"Hey all, hope you're keeping well during these weird times.

I'm hoping someone has similary symptoms to me and can give some clarity / experience, because my doctors apparently can't. 

First off, my symptoms for about 4 years now: 

**- A 'clogged up' feeling, like I'm constantly breathing through cotton wool.**

**- Mucus in the throat that never, ever clears**

**- I get frequent searing sharp pains in the right side of my chest by my ribs. I also get infrequent sharp shooting pains breathing in sometimes in my chest, stomach, and collarbones**

**- Inability to exercise for more than a couple of minutes no matter my fitness level**

My history: smoked for three years since the age of 13 then quit. Was always extremely fit, able to run for an hour etc. The only weird symptoms I ever had was excess mucus from around 10 years old, which I recognise now as allergy symptoms. At age 20 I got my first bout of breathlessness I've ever had - docs told me it was asthma, and sent me how with a blue inhaler (salbutamol) and a preventative steroid inhaler. 

Neither of those seemed to improve anything, because even though I was still able to exercise, as the months and years wore on I progressively got breathless quicker and quicker. Eventually I got to the point that I'm at now: after 1-2 minutes of hard exercise, my lungs close up and I can barely draw breath. I feel like I'm about to pass out, and it can take me an hour to get back to normal. It's not a question of fitness because I've gone through months of consecutive days of trying to push past this limit; it may improve by a minute or so after weeks of trying, but I invariably reach a point of having to stop once my lungs constrict. The most interesting part of this in my opinion is that during these moments, my blue inhaler has **never** alleviated symptoms. 

This was confirmed by a lung function test that I took to determine the effect salbutamol had on my lungs; precisely zilch. Anecdotally, whenever I come off steroids I do feel horrible, but I wonder if that's because I'm coming off steroids more than because they improve anything. I've tried various other inhalers too. Anything they've prescribed me has categorically failed to improve my exercise-induced broncho-constriction. I've been on steroids for 6 years now.

On top of this (or, I'm starting to suspect, as a direct result of this) my allergy symptoms have got to the point where they pretty much dominate my life. After my lung function test they sent me to someone who actually knew what they were doing / cared, and he had the bright idea to test me for allergies, which meant that it only took 5 years for that to pop into anyone's head. Results were that I'm allergic to dog dander, grass, trees and dust mites. I have taken Fexofenadine (didn't work) and Montelukast (works slightly for allergy symptoms alone but also makes me depressed - great trade off!). I am due to have an exercise test etc. to figure out the issue, but no doubt that will take another couple of years.

I've had full chest scans etc. and none of the lung function tests have unearthed anything that suggests anything more sinister, which is good because I spent years in depression thinking I had undiagnosed COPD. Thing is, I don't know what it is - is this all due to allergies? Will anything help? Do you have a similar story, or any idea what my condition is?

Anyway, My doc did the spirometer tests on me 5 or 6 times - all normal.  She gave me a nebulizer treatment just to see if it made my numbers higher and it did not.

I (32F) have been diagnosed with asthma after two years of showing up in emerg with shortness of breath. I never wheezed, it was just as if the ceiling of how much air I could take in was very low. I sometimes had a tiny bit of a cough if I breathed in as deep as I could. Just a little “kehkeh.” 

Finally, I was referred to a Respirologist. I did the first pulmonary function test which was relatively normal. Then I did the methicholine challenge and reacted after the first dose. 

Finally, last Thursday (May 21), I was started on Symbicort 200 Turbuhalor, two puffs in the morning and two before bed. 

After just two doses, I started to feel like I need to clear my throat, all day every day. Like there’s something stuck low in my throat and if I could just get it out, I’d be great. It’s right above the sternal notch (where the collar bones meet), and I just can’t seem to work much of anything up.

18,"Hi! So as the title says, I'm a little confused and unsure about my asthma diagnosis and I was just wondering if anybody had any similar experiences or symptoms they could share with me. I'm a 26F, and was diagnosed with asthma as a kid (probably around age 7 or 8) and put on a diskus inhaler and I believe chewable singulair. The diagnosis was made by a PA at my pediatrician's clinic while she was on leave or something, and when she got back she told my parents she didn't think I have asthma and that I was just getting anxious and struggling to breathe due to anxiety so she took me off all the meds. I also had hardcore seasonal and pet allergies as a kid (and still do).

Fast forward to now, I've been struggling more than ever with seasonal allergies and with trouble breathing. I was feeling like I couldn't get a real breath or like I was trying to breathe through a thick blanket...but I don't think I was ever wheezing. I also have a dry cough for at least an hour in the mornings (have for as long as I can remember) and frequent chest tightness. Went to see my primary doctor, and she gave me albuterol and singulair. I was hitting the albuterol before exercise and as needed, and finding I needed it at least twice per day so she prescribed a maintenance inhaler (advair) to use for two weeks. I've been on it for a little less than a week and I feel probably the best I've ever felt physically...I don't need to hit the albuterol except before exercise and I don't need to take breaks throughout the day to lean over and try to breath. However, I think it's too early for the advair to actually be working so now it has me wondering if it is just anxiety and I'm gettting a placebo effect from the advair. Or maybe the singulair is now really starting to kick in and that's why I feel so much better? My first visit with my PCP was a telehealth consult where she prescribed the albuterol and singulair, then two weeks later I went back and she did lung tests after which she prescribed the advair. But she said my lung tests were ""pretty normal"" and that my lungs sound clear. She thinks I have mild asthma being triggered by bad seasonal allergies, and she said she doesn't think it's anxiety. But I guess I'm feeling unsure because of the normal lung tests and the lack of wheezing. Anyone feel similarly or have similar experiences?

I have already read some Dupixent posts on this Reddit as well as the eczema Reddit but would like to hear some (positive) experiences since most posts are focusing on quite intense side effects etc.
I (f, 31yo) have been suffering from asthma my whole life, and it tends to be rather atypical, I have relatively good months (running and boxing 4-5 hrs a week) but also months and months of exacerbations and prednison use. This comes with chronical sinus infections and seasonal allergies. I use 200% of inhaled steroids as maintenance according to my pulmonary specialist and after going back and forth for months I now got approved for Dupixent. I'm very exciting to start based on the reported results and my hopes are that this will make my daily life a little easier with the goal to limit the inhaled steroids to at least normal levels.

I'm absolutely OK with injecting myself (at least I think), although I have to do it all by myself the first time, since I'm not allowed to come in office due to COVID.

Has anybody else had similar issues? I'm still quite nervous, I haven't found any reports with lumps on the tongue being associated with oral thrush. It hurts to swallow, just hurts in general.",Asthma,Fluticasone and oral thrush - lump on tongue,1590529152

Ive seen in my town people are starting to become more laid back and taking less and less precautions as far as social distancing goes.
I have been more cautious than most during this time and I am still remaining very socially distant. 

I work in a retail job. After the last two weeks working in the back office, the owner today told me that we are opening to the public tomorrow and I’m expected to work in the front. 

My boss has passive aggressively expressed that I have been dragging my social distancing on too long. I was working from home when our state was on lockdown while everyone else at the business was still working on site. 
She has been pretty rude this whole time, telling random customers about my asthma and asking me if I miss being outside.

I have never been formally diagnosed with Asthma instead I've always had terrible allergies against pretty much anything and the allergies would restrict my ability to breathe. So my parents got me a doctor who gave me all these asthma medications Advair and Maxair and the problem got worse to the point just taking a brisk walk would give me an asthma attack and I'm not even obese. 

So as I got older I realized these drugs are going to kill me (did research and found people have literally died from these drugs)  so I stopped taking them and have tried to deal with the attacks without medication. It took years but I managed to get myself mostly normal where I can run without instantly going into an asthma attack and can go hiking in the mountains without an attack.

Now I noticed I seem to be getting worse for some reason regressing back to when I would randomly get Asthma attacks from even light physical assertion.

41,Hi all. I was recently diagnosed with mild asthma (mild flare ups MAYBE once or twice a week at most I think) and I was hoping someone could give me their personal experiences with Albuterol. It makes me very nervous to take it because I also take Prozac for my anxiety and I’ve seen that there’s possible interactions with heart rhythm on both of these. I hardly ever feel the need to use my inhaler as I feel like flare ups are mainly caused by my acid reflux that I’m on Pantoprazole for. But every once in a while I get these slight pains in my left lung. There’s no real shortness of breath. Just slight coughing and what I think is wheezing (I’m still not really sure what wheezing sounds like). But every time I get these pains I get very anxious about it and am somewhat scared to use my inhaler. I’ve used it before while being on Prozac and didn’t feel too bad so I’m assuming I’ll be okay to take it more but it also makes me very anxious that my heart rate goes up and I feel shaky after taking it. Does anyone else get this way? I use a Fitbit and my heart rate is faster when I take the Albuterol. I’m very new to this whole asthma thing and I’m still very confused about it.

43,"Hi! I am writing this to hopefully get some advice or perhaps hear from someone who has been through something similar. 

To give you a bit of background I am a 30 year old male and have had a fair few health issues over the last 10 or so years. I have been diagnosed with Asthma, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, General Anxiety Disorder and Acid Reflux. I have managed to get the majority of these conditions under control, I am now able to do more exercise and I am employed full time (I was bed bound for 4 years previously). My anxiety is at a relatively manageable level, I attribute a lot of this to coming off caffeine in all forms and I am on daily medication for acid reflux and asthma (Pantoprazole and Fostair).

However, for the last few years I have been experiencing extreme shortness of breath 24/7. At first I assumed this may be due to my asthma but I have been taking a steroid inhaler for around 10 years and it pretty much resolved all my asthma symptoms. I have been to multiple doctors about the problem but all my Lung Function tests were fine as were all tests on my heart and blood. Of course I am aware of how many bizarre symptoms anxiety can cause it just feels very different to my usual anxiety symptoms and more asthma like. In order to not waffle on for too long I have bullet pointed the current main symptoms I am experiencing in case anyone can help in any way. Obviously I am struggling to get a doctors appointment at the moment and it seems futile due to the fact I have had the majority of tests anyway and they tend to shrug their shoulders a bit!

So my current symptoms are:

**Shortness of breath** \- This feels as if my lungs will not inflate fully, probably more like to 50% and I cannot seem to exhale all the air fully which then means I cannot inhale fully for the next breath! My nose is also constantly blocked and my respiratory muscles just feel so weak although apparently all tests are fine. I am waking up in the night gasping for air a lot so it just does not feel right. I should also mention this gets very bad the day after drinking alcohol to the point that I have had to give it up as I can barely breathe the next day. 

**Cannot Cough** \- This is perhaps the most worrying symptom for me, I seem to have lost the ability to cough properly. Because I cannot get all the air in and out it feels as if the muscles used to cough have weakened significantly.

**Tightness in chest** \- This is 24/7 and feels horrible, like someone is tightening a belt around my pectoral muscles, it also gets much much worse after trying to do any weight related or gym exercises like bench presses or push ups

**Upper back/neck pain** \- I would not class the pain as severe but it is pretty constant, my back just feels inflamed and it cracks constantly, along with my sternum. My posture is not great and I am working on reconditioning my core muscles and fixing my posture but I have only really just started this.

**Fullness after eating** \- I cannot seem to eat as much now without feeling extremely full, it's like there is just suddenly far less room in my stomach for food and my stomach gets so bloated and hard after eating, this makes the shortness of breath even worse.

Full disclaimer: I used to smoke a bit when I had had a few drinks, not the smartest thing to do when I have asthma I know but my willpower is not the best when drunk. I have not had a cigarette in 3 months though.

Thanks for reading and apologies for the ramblings, my current thoughts are that it may have something to do with anxiety/asthma/reflux but I would be very grateful if anyone else has any advice or perhaps any other ideas as to what could be causing the symptoms.

My asthma has been manageable with advair and albuterol since I was a teenager, but in the last few days, I've had some weird shortness of breath that I can't seem to kick. I don't have my usual asthma wheeze, however deep breaths  require more effort, and I feel a hot sensation in my throat/chest. It's almost like heartburn, but it isn't painful, just anxiety-inducing because I feel like I'm not getting all the air I need.

48,"The old CFC inhalers were better. When they did that ozone pact (Montreal Protocol) they should have excluded life saving medication. I had an rare incident where I was out of my nebulizer medicine so I had to rely on the HFA Proventil inhaler.  I noticed the more I took the rescue inhaler the more I needed. I could feel my lungs lock up over it more and as the 12 hours progressed. It was a Sunday and couldn't get to the pharmacy. I could feel my lungs allow less and less of the medicine in to my lungs. This caught my attention. I've had asthma my whole life. I dug through my old medication (never throw anything out) and found a CFC inhaler! I was so excited. So I took 1 puff. It opened my airways and I was good for another 12 hours. WOW huge difference. So then I started researching why if the medicine is the same. Turns out they use ethanol as the propellant and is a known bronchial constrictor. WOW.  I was really upset. How to new or young people know this if they never used the CFC inhaler. At the time there was a website (archive link below) and it listed people that died from the switch. It had all types of proof and information but sadly it is gone and I don't know who was behind it. I imagine big pharma threatened them. Pharma waited until the end to make switch and got the FDA to bypass rigorous testing.  So frustrating.   


What I did was this: I stopped getting brands that use ethanol. I tried Xopenex and it works okay. Not as good for me but a LOT better than ethanol locking up my lungs. I then got a prescription for albuterol liquid and NOT pre-mixed tubes, the straight up medicine in a little bottle with a dropper. I do this because sometimes I only need .3 ml and others .5ml. (I learned this from a really good asthma doctor as a teen he taught me so much because my asthma was bad at times, 20ish years ago) Then ordered on Amazon the saline filled tubes. I have had a nebulizer for over 30 years so I am very familiar with them. I found one on craigslist. You can buy new tubing at traditional pharmacy or elderly medical supply store and it's pretty inexpensive.   


I hope this helps. In my opinion it doesn't even make sense to take the ethanol inhaler because it makes it worse and works opposite from the medication.

55,"This past winter I was diagnosed with asthma by an allergy doctor. I was also tested for different allergens, and it was found I was allergic to dust mites.

I’ve since made my bedroom more “dust mite proof.” I moved into a new room with a hardwood floor, and removed lots of knick knacks and other objects that tend to collect dust. I am also keeping everything very clean.

I’m prescribed Symbicort and a rescue Albuterol inhaler. I admit I’ve taken the Symbicort inconsistently, but when I was taking it regularly I still had no real improvement of my symptoms, namely chest tightness and a persistent cough I’ve had for around 2 years. The Albuterol is trash—I’ve taken it for when my chest tightness or coughing gets very severe, and I don’t think there’s been one time where it has actually relieved my symptoms.

I went to my PCP 2 days ago. He thinks I may not have asthma at all, considering I don’t respond to the Albuterol. I was also given a spirometer test, and he informed me it came back completely normal. 

I had a chest X-ray done in preparation for a TeleHealth visit with a pulmonologist. The results from that came back normal, and she prescribed me montelukast to take at night, and zyrtec to take during the daytime. My PCP also prescribed me a fluticasone propionate nasal spray, because he believes I have postnasal drip.

The pulmonologist also recommended I take Afrin for 5-7 days. My checkup appointment is a little over a month from now, so I’m really hoping any of these medications will help me (and I am definitely going to take the Symbicort more regularly). 

But, holy shit. My chest pain has really increased over the last few days, and I have no idea why. I’ve been taking the Albuterol, with no luck. My chest pain is a little different today, but it feels like there’s tightness and some sort of deep “tickle” right in my sternum. 3 days ago I also had some of the worst chest pain I’ve ever experienced. I was nonstop hacking up saliva with every cough, and it felt like there was a crushing weight sitting right on my chest.

Is there anything I can do before the next checkup appointment to help alleviate the pain? It’s really messing with my mood and making it hard to breathe at certain times.

I'm currently on daily albuterol and steroids to help prevent the attacks from happening so frequently. To make matters worse, my only real career skill experience is in finishing drywall, which has always been an impact on my health as far as controlling my flair ups has gone. It wasnt easy working as I always had to carry my nebulizer with me and at times, stop almost 10-12 times a day to use it before I felt my wheezing and breathing to disperse temporarily. Because of Covid-19, I haven't been able to work whatsoever.

My doctor suggests I shouldnt continue that profession anyways, as the job sites are extremely dusty and hazardous to my breathing. The predicament however, is I dont think I'd be able to really hold down a traditional job, as I wouldn't really be able to stop mid shifts to do my nebulizer as needed. Plus, being high risk, I dont believe being in public jobs is ideal for my health considering the current corcumstances. I've used rescue inhalers before, and most times it only helps temporarily and I use them up in a week or so, and the prescriptions are extremely expensive compared to the nebulizer solution Albuterol.

My question is, because of my medical history, would I be able to qualify for disability? As my medicine taking really interferes with my daily tasks even when I'm just at home. It's really troublesome because I have 2 babies and 2 step children I care for, and not having income at this time has been extremely stressful. I don't want to lose my place or not be able to provide for my family. I've been ventilated in the past, and I've been admitted to the hospital more than I can count my entire life. I just need some advice as to how the process will go, I've never applied for disability before because I never wanted to hang up being able to work and tried my best to try to maintain my health, but considering all the circumstances, I really dont have any choice right now. Ive also heard if you're denied you cant reapply for another 2 months. It's also difficult to acquire a disability lawyer as I dont have the funds to do so. So I'm just curious how I should approach the application and explain my situation as to where the case manager will understand the severity of my condition and the inability to work. It's hard to get all my hospital records as I've always ended up in the emergency room throughout my life, even for medicine due to not having insurance, plus I've been to several different hospitals in different cities and states due to always moving around in my life. Please, any information will be appreciated and thank you for your time.

-and you want to take your flow after medication
-for 2 weeks

I’ve taken azithromycin before, I usually get bronchitis once or twice a year and pneumonia every now and again. I was not prepared for prednisone.

Hey Nikki I got tested today due to some symptoms. I wanted to ask a question about normal blood spo2 levels since uve been monitoring my parents spo2 lately.

I've been monitoring them for about 4 days now, today being the fourth.


My dad and mother have asthma that is well controlled.

My mother averages 96 to 97 spo2.

My father was averaging 96 to 97 four days days ago, as well as yesterday and the day before yesterday

Today he was at 95%, and dropped a few times to 94%, which then went up to 95%.

He was sitting in a recliner chair.

I put him back in his computer chair which is where I had been testing him the first three days that he was 96 to 97. He was at 95 to 96 in said chair. I asked him to do deep breaths several times through the day and each time he would climb from 95 or 96, up to 97 or 98. Then once he seized the deep breaths would go back down to 95 or 96.

The thing that concerns me a bit is his few 94 readings........ am I freaking out?
 am I being unreasonable? I heard 93 and below is a problem..... so I'm keeping an eye out.

He may have been exposed two days ago and perhaps this is a symptom of covid slowly lowering his oxygen?

64,"hi, i created this account just because i'm feeling so frustrated with my asthma and i like to look at this reddit because it gives me some hope.

I've had asthma my whole life. I'm 21 now and the past six months is the worst it's ever been. Up until that point I was on Singulair 10mg only in the winter when my asthma was it's worst. I used to take flovent (the lowest dose) in the winter as well. I would take albuterol only when I had chest tightness which was really rare, maybe once or twice a month, and that would always make it go away. When I was even younger I would use a nebulizer and had a few attacks, but mostly grew out of that. 

I used to be really active and able to exercise. I hiked all the time and have even summited some mountains. Now I can't even climb the stairs without running out of breath. My entire life feels like it's been consumed by trying to manage my asthma. 

I had an asthma attack in August right before my birthday. I was alone in my apartment. I probably took my rescue inhaler six times and nothing happened. I felt like my vision was starting to cloud and I was trying to stay calm. I could not get in a deep breath. I had to call a friend to drive me to the hospital because I couldn't afford an ambulance. They gave me prednisone right away and I was doing nebulizer treatments for four hours. 

This happened again three times in the following two months. 

I'm now on 10mg Singulair, Flonaze, Zyrtec, and 2 inhalations 500/50 Advair every day. I'll feel better for a few days and then back down to feeling bad for weeks. I've spent most of the past few weeks just in bed, sleeping. I don't have the energy to do anything. I can't exercise or sing or even walk around without stopping to catch my breath. Even eating makes me lose my breath, so my appetite has just plummeted lately. The hardest part is that no matter how many times I've been to the doctor, my peak flow, spirometry, pulseox are fine. I got a lung x-ray during my third attack and it was normal. I feel like I should be okay, but I'm constantly straining to breathe. 

My doctor just recently bumped my Advair from 250/50 to 500/50. I felt better for about four days and am now feeling worse. As soon as I had a little bit of hope that I was getting better it's gone. I'm anxious and depressed all the time because I feel like I will never get my life back. Even before the pandemic, I could hardly go out or spend time with anyone because I was always weak and lightheaded. I yawn all the time and wake up in the middle of the night trying to catch my breath. I feel so frustrated and at a loss for what to do. 

I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to potentially restart prednisone. A few months ago she told me that my lungs were probably damaged from all the asthma attacks I had on top of one another, as well as it not being properly controlled for a long time. I just want to know that I'm not alone, or that things will get better. If you've had the kind of damage my doctor is talking about, were you ever able to reverse it?

75,"Well, it's been a weird road. I didn't realize I had breathing issues because they were a slow burn. Sometimes I actually just nearly blacked out or past out constantly when I was a teen after doing some physical activity and struggling to get enough air.

I kind of blamed it on me being fat. I was, like, 180 pounds and 5""6 and incredibly sedentary, pretty heavy for a girl. Played games a lot. I still, however, experienced similar periods of almost fainting even after finally losing the life-long weight in my early 20s and  got more active.

Honestly I never really had periods where I had full-on hyperventilation other than the times I used to wake up (got a bit better after I lost weight) being completely unable to breathe for almost a minute and had to fight just to get a breath in. I don't really understand what this is but it was terrifying.

I didn't really have anyone at all to tell this to when I was a kid besides myself--and I told myself that I was just imagining things and this stuff was 100% normal. I started looking into my breathing issues when I was about 21 and actually sorta independent. First it was discovered in a breathing test at the doctors that my lung capacity was far, far below what it should be - and that it never got higher. I was diagnosed with asthma and prescribed the inhaler+singulair. Secondly later on I found out that I actually had a severe nose deformity that blocked my nose and that, yup, I also just thought that was completely normal my entire life. After the surgery I felt better but still experienced that overwhelming, very consistent sense of being physically incapable of getting a full breath.

On Bronkaid? My lungs feel way much more opened up. I actually can exercise and not feel like passing out. What I find extremely perplexing is that actually when I exercise while on it, I actually increasing get more energy and feel more awake which is basically the opposite of, well, my entire life.

It's like a double edged sword. There's about a 70% chance of me feeling actually like I have some semblance of energy on it for once which is unheard of for me, and then feel the energy towards the...what the heck is this wizardry...the ENTIRE DAY?? Moreover on Bronkaid, I take before/afters of my face and the severe dark circles are gone and my eyes look less red. My eyes stop aching and burning as well.

In general I just feel less lethargic and numb.

And moreover when I take it before bed it usually helps me actually wake up almost feeling...refreshed. Like. Not all the way. But pretty good. I have only woke up once in my life feeling refreshed, aside from the Bronkaid day, and for some reason that was the only day I've ever stayed up all night and then slept during the day.

But with that said there's a small chance that it just makes me feel nauseous or get this weird sweat or...that weird numb feeling, weirdly, gets worse. I'm not sure if I'm imagining things there.

So yeah I find it all quite perplexing and I don't really understand it. Honestly it might be just that it's acting as a stimulant and maybe the effect I'm having is ""baby's first drug"" or something. I didn't at all expect for it to work at all as my prescribed medications never did. At best maybe Singulair had a fraction of the effect but it was so mild that it was hard to even pick up.

Anyway that's that. Sorry about all the text.

88,"I think I have asthma, but I don’t know what to do.

Super long post… tl;dr at bottom.

I’ve always had slight difficulty breathing. I did sports when I was in middle and high school. Even when I was in the best shape of my life, I would get out of breath super easily. I remember being embarrassed about it because I didn’t want people to think I was out of shape because I was breathing so heavily after so little exercise. Whenever I would sing in the choir as a kid, I would find myself yawning throughout the songs, but not because I was tired.

Even when I’m not out of breath, I can never seem to get enough air in my lungs. Sometimes I have to breathe in in a really weird way. The only way I can describe it is if I take a breath that fills up 75% of my lungs. No matter how deep of a breath I take, I can’t get that extra 25% percent filled. Sometimes I can take a breath in a weird way and I get this feeling of actually filling up my lungs. Also sometimes yawning achieves this. I used to get by with doing this only every once in a while.

One time last year, I felt like I couldn’t catch my breath. I kept trying to do the weird deep breath thing, but I just couldn’t get it. It kept escalating until I was wheezing and everything was going a little fuzzy. I’m not sure if I lost consciousness, but it eventually stopped. Ever since that happened, I’ve had a harder time breathing and I also feel like I have to do the deep breath thing more often. This has happened again since then, maybe a couple times. The most recent time was like two nights ago and now I’m having an even harder time catching my breath.

There have been a couple times (literally like twice I think) I’ve had oxygen through a cannula, both times while having dental procedures. The most recent was when I got my wisdom teeth out, but this happened both times. When I had the cannula in for a few minutes, I felt different. I felt kind of funny, I almost don’t know how to describe it. It felt good. Not like a high, just a bit clearer.

As a kid, whenever I played in a fort made out of blankets (or anything similar), I would always get short of breath really quickly and have to leave the fort. Now, if I have my face under the covers while I’m in bed, I can only stand it for a moment before I’m short of breath and need to stick my face out. With this COVID-19 crisis, I’ve been wearing a face mask when I have to go out in public. I find myself unable to breathe. These past few weeks have been the worst as far as breathing goes. I constantly feel out of breath, I can never catch my breath and I hate that damn mask.

I read [this post](https://imgur.com/a/8Hjdyqw) and it kind of clicked. The way the person was talking about “the perfect inhale” is exactly how I feel.

I want to go to the doctor to see if I have asthma, but I don’t know how to go about doing that. Especially with the current situation with the virus. I feel like if I want into a doctor’s office and say that I’m having difficulty breathing, even if I explain everything, they’ll quarantine me and worry about corona before doing anything else. And how do I even go about seeing a doctor for this? I’m a student, so I don’t really have a primary care physician. I just go to the student clinic on campus if I have an issues. Since it’s summer and there’s the virus, I don’t really know if that’s an option for me right now though. I just want to breathe, damnit.

tl;dr: There are some things that I think point towards me having asthma, or some sort of breathing difficulty at the least.

I went to the GP and he's diagnosed asthma and given me a Clenil inhaler, ive also just had two weeks off and thought the breathing would be better returning to work today. Breathing had eased up a bit before this. Today was awful though, I kept having to hide in cupboards whilst I took my mask off and tried to get my breath back, puffed away on salbutamol all day and then had palpitations all afternoon. I work in A&amp;E, its very unnerving for patients when their nurse looks worse than they do. 

Is anyone else in healthcare having this problem? or does anyone have any advice for newly diagnosed asthmatics and when clenil will start having an effect? Asthmatic clinics aren't happening atm and I'm trying to avoid ask anyone at work because that will be mortifying when it inevitably happens (or someone finds me passed out in a store room, whichever comes first).

92,I need help finding a good shampoo and conditioner that isn’t loaded with perfume. I can’t handle how intense the smells are. I use dr bronner Castile for shampoo which I love. It’s light. I have super thick and long hair (F) and need a good conditioner or my hair is unmanageable but all the conditioner are so heavily scented. It triggers my asthma.

93,"Hello guys

Today I came across an article that talks about Vitamin C and asthma and basically concluded that  ""the role of vitamin C in asthma and allergy is not well defined""

94,"I've had severe asthma since I was a kid. I'm pretty heathy in every other way. I tried to go for a slow jog because I've always wanted to run a 5k someday. After 15 minutes and less than a mile I almost fainted. I was seeing spots, coughing, and I threw up in someone's yard. I used my emergency inhaler before and twice during my run, plus my daily ICS this morning and I'm still unable to even jog. The walk home I was panicking and staggering and crying, even though my actual body wasn't even tired.

I know logically that it's not my fault, but I hate myself for being so vunerable. I'm so ashamed and discouraged, it makes me never want to excersize again.",Asthma,I tried to run and threw up on the ground.,1589912082
95,Just went for a run and checked peak flow when I came back and it was significantly higher than what it usually is. I’m in the 550 range normally but it was around 650-660 after running about a mile. Is this normal?,Asthma,Peak flow higher after exercising?,1589893029
96,"Hey what's up.

I am a 30 year old dude who recently decided to become more healthier and lose some weight. I picked up Running again about a month ago after quitting smoking cigarettes for somewhat 10ish years. I also stopped smoking weed and tobacco (we mix it here) about a month ago. I am also using an inhaler for the past 4 5 years every night before going to bed because my asthma flares up at night and in lying positions.

So far everything went great, until last weekend I offered myself a little treat to celebrate the positive changes and rewarded myself some weed. I finished the 10g I bought  alreadybut for the past two days i have been coughing my brains out and feeling my lungs added 30 years of heavy smoking to its toll. How is that possible if I treated them very good for one month for them to act up like this now.",Asthma,Smoking,1589890256
97,"Hey so I have a spacer with a mask and was only just prescribed this. (I used to just use the easi-breathe inhaler for my reliever, it has an automatic puff which I got on fine with) I’ll post the whole malarkey on why I didn’t have an inhaler in a later post
(if people want the “tea” lol) but anyway I didn’t have one and the out of hours dr prescribed me an emergency Ventolin (Sabutamol) inhaler with a holding chamber and mask. It’s super bulky and because I’m not used to using the regular style inhaler I have to have this with me all the time. 

What are your best recommendations about storing this when taking it out? I know it’s not supposed to be dried with a towel as it makes it static. Thank you all in advance!",Asthma,"New here, advice on storing my holding chamber (spacer?) ?",1589880918
98,"I've been having almost constant shortness of breath for months now and my doctor said it's anxiety, but I feel that if it *was asthma* obviously not being able to breathe would cause me to panic and be anxious anyway.

 I don't have any wheezing but sometimes my chest and throat feel tight and almost always I feel like I can't get enough air in. There's also a weird cough that comes up every couple of months, I've had it for years and could never explain it. I feel like one side of my throat becomes irritated and I can't stop coughing until I drink some (a lot) of water. I literally carry a water bottle with me everywhere in case it happens. But this cough hasn't happened since the breathing problems started a couple of months ago.

I'm thinking about getting an asthma test but it's very expensive, for all I know it could just be anxiety. So since you guys know asthma better than anyone who isn't a doctor, does this sound anything like it?",Asthma,Can asthma have difficulty to breathe as the only symptom?,1589874099
99,"I’m 30 almost 31 and I’m terrified when I keep hearing about these 28, 21, 25, 35, year olds dying with NO pre existing conditions, or habits like I’ve had with smoking! My mom works in the lab and runs these tests all day, and she has asthma, she’s doing all she can to stay safe and removing her clothes downstairs before entering the house, and taking off her shoes, I asked for her to do this waaaay before the CDC started recommending it, but I’m sooo terrified still. I freaked out at Wal-Mart the other day because people just DONT CARE, about anyone. Themselves is it, not even realizing that to insure their longevity, they should be distancing just as hard as someone who’s very aware and takes precautions. So I panicked started yelling at people to follow the rules and the workers are asking what’s wrong. Why is the national guard here and nothing being enforced? What’s 6 feet apart at lines gone do if they just keep crossing me at 1 foot even less? anyway, please speak up cuz I need to know at least the 1 question, thanks.",Asthma,"Who has had COVID-19 with ASTHMA pre existing, and had MILD to ZERO SYMTPOMS?",1589870954
