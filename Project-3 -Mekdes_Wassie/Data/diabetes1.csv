I heard that a 1 time fasting reading above 99 makes you prediabetic, no matter the A1C. 

So I started testing my fasting glucose and post numbers.

For a week I had fasting numbers from 94-99 after getting out of bed. I am using the contour next one. I assume these numbers are bad since I read a study about how fasting above 90 puts you at risk of heart disease (http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/fasting-blood-sugar-above-90-puts-you-at-risk-of-heart-disease/)

1 hour after eating 96g of carbs (Trader Joe’s blintzes) my glucose was at 121 mg/dL. 2 hours later it was 96 mg/dL. 

However, I don’t understand where the 123 mg/dL from the lab came from. Unless my meter is broken.

My daughter (15m old) was diagnosed T1 last week.
As a good Geek Daddy I started looking around the possibilities.
She has 2 devices: Omnipod Dash (with Android PDM) &amp; Freestyle Libre 2.

So why this title “FR vs US” ?

BECAUSE ANY RECENT GOOD TECH IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN US!

For example:
- omnipod view app not available in FR stores
- Omnipod PDM is locked: no wifi, no bluetooth sharing (seems to be the OS version, resetting the phone does not offer to choose US Region)
- People here seem to ignore Dexcom: doctors, drug stores…
- Freestyle Libre 3 not available (even not knowm from FR Abort Support)
- Freestyle Libre 2 not covered under 4-years-old


I suppose most of the reasons are linked to health data storage, cloud act etc.
But I would really love automatic alarms during the night even though I’m not American.

Eventually, I tried to buy/use American versions of the device. Even if it would imply to sign whatever paperwork to allow US to store my daughter’s sugar rates… Each time I was told it’s not possible.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother has had type 2 diabetes ever since I can remember. This required me to know, since I was about 6 or 7, what to do if my mother was in a diabetic coma or had low blood sugar.

I basically grew up learning the signs of low blood sugar, and sometimes even holding down my mother as she becomes incoherent and forcing her to drink juice, as when her blood sugar began to get low she often refuses food or drink that will bring it back up. Or what to do if I was alone in a grocery store or in public and her blood sugar would drop, as this would often happen. 

It began to happen \*a lot\* and sometimes she would take insulin so that it would get low when she was in a place far away from help. (After this, my Dad began carrying a lunchbox with juice in it everywhere they went) She went to the hospital in an ambulance due to a low blood sugar coma about once a year pretty consistently, and markedly it seemed almost every time we went out to eat, or someone brought a friend over her blood sugar would drop.

It sometimes feels as if she does this on purpose, and while she was on an automatic insulin pump for a few weeks, she decided to stop using it because she didn't like how it beeped.

53,"Hey everyone.

I’ve been experiencing some weird symptoms but have conflicting or non-confirmative lab result or answers from any doctors. The entire concept of diabetes/blood-sugar is new to me, and I can’t say I understand all the dynamics, and feel a bit overwhelmed by all information online, especially when it’s conflicting. I was hoping more experienced persons could help me make sense of this. 

Here’s what I have for objective evidence:

-Fasting blood sugar is always normal (usually between 90-100).
-Fasting insulin level is 47 uIU/ML (I was told the range is between 3-19).
-Blood sugar after eating sugar/carbs spikes to usually around 160-230 within minutes.
-Had gastric bypass in 2020.

Anecdotal:
-Sicker than a dog when eating sugar or carbs. This has gotten a tiny bit worse since weight loss surgery, but I’ve had this issue with certain foods for over a decade. I have digestive issues with most foods, always have, but exponentially worse with sugar.
-Was never drastically overweight until put on Gabapentin, and then got to 216 lbs. These issues existed even when at a normal weight (130). 
-Within minutes of eating sugar or carbs, heart races, feel dizzy/vertigo/balance issues, eyes have trouble focusing, sometimes get weakness, shaky and confusion. I always feel extremely fatigued and out of it.  Blood sugar is always high when this happens and symptoms last for a while after, even if blood sugar is back to “normal”.
-Start feeling symptoms when it gets over 125 or so. Seems very sensitive. 
-I have never seen a low blood sugar reading, so I don’t know if hypoglycemia is possible or just “hidden” some way. 

I realize dumping syndrome probably plays a part in this, but I had all of these issues way before WLS and my blood sugar is always high very quickly after meals, and correlates to my worse symptoms.

I don’t understand why it gets so high, so quickly, or why my fasting insulin is so high while my blood sugar is normal.

What might be happening here and what can I do to mitigate or heal this? (I know this is not a medical forum and don’t take any responses as medical advice.)

I’ve already ruled out many possible causes such as insulin pooling or scar tissue, along with basal. I also know that the pump I have is part of a recall but the affected part wasn’t broken on my pump and I periodically check it to make sure. 

Since starting to use this pump I’ve noticed weird times where my blood sugar will drop a lot more than what it should for the amount of insulin I gave, because of this I often override what the pump wants to give me by A LOT. 

Last night at 3AM my blood sugar was 360 and I had 0.4u of active insulin, knowing how my pump tends to respond or maybe my anxiety, I gave 0.6u and went to bed. I woke up 7 hours later at 100. 

To me, I would not expect a 0.8u per hour basal and only 1 unit of insulin to drop me 260 points over night unless the pump is not functioning right. 

The pump wanted to give me 3.9u which is what I’ve been told should be the proper correction for a 360 for my weight and age. My dad thinks that the pump is ignoring the overrides and giving a full bolus. 

My blood sugars and rates are overall a mess so thats not the point of this post, I’m just curious if anyone else has had issues that seem like the pump is over-delivering.",diabetes,Insulin Pump over-delivering? (670g),1630942215

73,"So I'm in my 40's and pretty healthy by all accounts (don't smoke, drink in moderation, plenty of exercise etc) and no real underlying health conditions (mild asthma but I manage that quite easily). In April 2021 I had my first Covid AstraZeneca jab and within about 2 days started to feel pretty bad. Flu-like symptoms and headaches, which I assumed would go away but after a week I still had them. In the end I had flu-like symptons and severe migraines for about a month, vertigo, insomnia, abdominal pains and a superficial blood clot down the right-hand side of my ribs (condition called Mondor's Disease).

It took me a while to get my GP to take any of this seriously (I'm in the UK so our GPs are generally shit, in my experience) and he kept writing it off as coincidence, and the blood clot wasn't a blood clot in his opinion it was a pulled muscle (definitely a misdiagnoses, as conformed by a later ultra sound scan). As part of the blood tests they eventually ran I was told I had high fasting blood glucose levels and was basically pre-diabetic. News to me as I've never had issues like this before and nor do they run in my family. Again it was denied any relation to the AZ vaccine and it was just a coincidence.

I bought a finger-prick blood glucose monitor and over the next 8-12 weeks my levels pretty much went back to normal (from about 8mm/l in the morning to the expected 5, and from 9-10mm/l two hours after eating to between 5-6).

Due to my adverse reaction to the first jab I had to have more tests (blood platelet count etc) and wait until the clot had (mostly) resolved before they gave me the 2nd AZ jab. Again told it was safe the first reaction was mostly coincidence. So two days after the second jab I'd just eating over fish and mushy peas (hardly a high carb meal). Two hours later took my blood sugar level and it was 11.6 mm/l, which is the highest it's ever been!

I've taken more readings since then and it's back to being high again (higher than with the first jab) although this time I fortunately don't seem to have gotten the pounding headaches etc.

Again my GP says it's just coincidence, and I know a sample of 1 is basically anecdotal evidence, but t have the same reaction twice in a row seems to be stretching the coincidence claim a bit. Also they are supposed to report these sorts of incidences to the NHS, but I know they have not (at least not in my case). Makes me wonder how many people are having non-fatal but still quite bad reactions to the Covid vaccines, and why are they seemingly playing it down?

Hello r/diabetes/,

I am a 40 year old male who was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes at the end of June, 2021 with an A1C of 9.4 after having been previously diagnosed as having prediabetes with an A1C of 6.1 in October of 2018.  After the initial prediabetes diagnosis in 2018, I swore off soda and endeavoured to ensure my next bloodwork result wouldn't be worse. After the prediabetes diagnosis, I was given a prescription for metformin, but my digestive tract had quite a bad time with that first attempt, and it quickly got lost in the shuffle of life. 

What happened between October 2018 and June 2021? Birth of two kids (months of no sleep + chaos/stress of 2-under-2 years old at home), close family member diagnosed with Alzheimer's (stress) and pandemic (stress), during which time I reverted to my time-tested tradition of eating my stress away (translation: lots of complex carbs + soda). 

After my t-2 diagnosis in June 2021, I decided it was imperative that I get my shit together and to better inform myself about what this diagnosis meant and how I could make sustainable lifestyle changes. One of my first Google searches landed me on Alan Shanley’s ( u/alan_s ) blog and the recommendation to test, test, test. I pulled out the dusty glucose meter that I bought back when I was diagnosed with prediabetes and started following the plan to test pre-meal, 1-hour post meal and 2-hours post meal to better inform myself of what the foods I was eating were doing to my glucose levels. 

Alan’s advice, plus other things I learned reading Alan’s book (What on Earth Can I Eat) and Jenny Ruhl’s two books (Blood Sugar 101 and Diet 101) showed me that it was possible to control my blood sugar levels by paying attention to what I ate. I also realized how little I understood about nutrition, given that I never thought twice about the impact that foods like pasta, rice or bread were having on my blood sugar levels. I previously, obviously incorrectly, assumed that blood glucose levels were a function of drinking soda and eating sweets. &lt;insert sad-sounding game show buzzer sound here&gt; 

Along the way, I also made an appointment with an endocrinologist who gave me a prescription for Ozempic after discussing my previous issue with metformin, along with a prescription for 10mg statin. I had cortisol, c-peptide and antibody bloodwork done via the endocrinologist to confirm that I was type-2 and not type-1. Best I  currently understand based on these results, my type-2 is due to insulin resistance due to years of terrible diet as I do not have insulin antibodies and my body is still producing insulin. As far as I know, there is no history of type-2 anywhere in my family. Shortly after getting the Ozempic prescription, I hit the part in Jenny’s book that discusses the potential issues with the pancreas associated with GLP-1 agonists and I then nope’d right out of that as an option. The endocrinologist had no issue pausing the Ozempic plan and seeing what I could do with diet/lifestyle changes.  

Somewhere around the time of reading this initial set of books, I landed on a YouTube video from a local cardiologist that kind of broke my brain: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFlZM5mlXTk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFlZM5mlXTk). The video talks about the issues with the Western diet and how the ‘lots of carbs/starches with veggies/fruits and little fat’ USDA food pyramid that I grew up with was completely wrong, essentially that the pyramid was inverted and we should be eating fewer carbs (especially complex) and more healthy fats. There are a series of books at the end of his video which I purchased and have been working through. These books are continuing to re-write what little I knew about biology/nutrition. I was able to meet this cardiologist briefly when accompanying a family member to an appointment and he recommended looking into Dr. Jason Fung’s books (Obesity Code, Diabetes Code, Complete Guide to Fasting). 

Dr. Fung’s books broke my brain all over again when I read about the impact that insulin had with regards to how the body regulates weight and also why my previously followed calories-in-calories-out (CICO) model of dieting didn’t work. Dr. Fung’s books also introduce the concept of intermittent fasting (IF) as a method for losing weight and managing glucose levels. I heard about IF in the past from colleagues who pointed me to the 2012 BBC documentary on the subject ([https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x370lox](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x370lox)) and a 2019 article from the New England Journal of Medicine about the effects of IF: [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1905136](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1905136). 

I didn’t realize at the time, but I had been doing a form of IF for years (16/8), albeit with a terrible high-carb/high-sugar diet, by skipping breakfast so that I could get an extra few minutes of sleep in the morning. Given that I’d done the 16/8 for so long, I decided to try a 24 hour fast which went without issue, followed a few days later with a 46.5 hour fast which also went without much fuss (blood glucose levels stayed steady the entire time). These two fasting experiments have made me question everything I ever learned about eating habits e.g. (don’t skip breakfast, it’s the most important meal!). I am curious to see how Dr. Fung’s claims that IF can help reduce insulin resistance pan out as I attempt to follow a low-carb/high healthy fat/IF diet over the next few months.

Where does that leave me now? Two months after my initial diagnosis, my fasting glucose levels have dropped from 179mg/dL to \~95mg/dL (see \[chart\](https://imgur.com/Ec0nSOm)) and the mySugr app that I have been using quasi-religiously (test before meal/1-hour after/2-hours after + fasting in morning) over the past month and half currently lists my estimated HbA1c at 5.4. I have lost \[30.6 pounds\](https://imgur.com/fljq4TE) after struggling with weight for years (number is likely a few pounds high due to the recent 46 hour fast which depleted glycogen stores). 

I also had bloodwork done about a month and a half after the initial diagnosis and found that my LDL cholesterol dropped from 125 to 84 and my triglycerides dropped from 319 to 116. Were those drops due to the statin, the diet change or both? Unsure as of yet, but I stopped taking the statin a week ago since it is known to increase insulin resistance and I’m more worried about that than my cholesterol at the moment. I have 3-month follow-up bloodwork coming up soon, so I’ll find out more and discuss that further then. I also got a prescription for a Libre Freesytle 2 CGM which I \[have been using for over a month\](https://imgur.com/dswKSPz) . I liked the CGM at first, but I love it now that the iOS app is out in the United States. I also have a few weeks worth of CGM vs. traditional meter data that I can share if there is interest, but the take home message for me is that the data the Libre 2 gives me matches almost exactly what my CGM (Verio OneTouch Reflect) measures.

All of that said, I am massively grateful to the /r/diabetes community (and related communities) for all of the posts and information available here, as they have made the start of this journey entirely more manageable and sustainable than it would have been otherwise. Where will I be a year from now? Who knows, but I’m optimistic that I have a much more concrete idea of what I should be doing diet-wise than I have been at any point in the past.

P.S. /u/sskaye/, I find your posts super interesting and your low-carb tortilla post (https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2021/08/low-carb-tortillas-how-do-different.html) has already helped to inform my weekly taco night, so thanks!",diabetes,Hello /r/diabetes!

My drive for trying to drive again is centered around my job. I've been getting rides to and from work and the only coworker available is retiring at the end of the year. Despite several convo's with my boss, he's unwilling to let me work first shift. So, if things don't pan out with night driving, I'm basically out of a job.

I don't know what to do. I have tried yellow sunglasses for night driving and they don't work. What I see is like shining light on frosted glass. The light flares out more than clear glass and that's basically how my left eye deals with headlights at night.

96,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 23 year old male, who is 6’1 and only barely 130 pounds. My diet is absolutely trash though. Starbucks fraps/cookies every second day, probably consuming 80 grams of a sugar a day when it should be half of that. Last night I realized how trash my diet has become. My dad is a type 2 diabetic, he was probably 20-25 pound overweight when he found out he got it (which is why I’m concerned more for myself). I’m also not very active, but I’ve had stretches of working out daily and being motivated. And I believe that’s coming again from what I’m about to tell you.

So today, I just had some bread and a glass of milk. Two hours later, I used my dad’s machine to get my level (changed the needle), and the result was 5.6. I did a blood test back in May, where I would have to fast for 12 hours, and my hemoglobin A1C was 5.4. I had another 12 hour fast blood test back in September of 2020, and my hemoglobin A1C was 5.3. I know that a blood test is a reflection of your levels from the past 2-3 months. 

I’m about to quit Starbucks pretty much; maybe only once a week, or less. I also eat fast food a lot (burgers really). However, looking at the nutritional guide, there’s 6G of sugar, but 45 grams of carbs. Do the carbs matter as much, or is it just the sugar? For the past few days, I’ve been running a mile as well a day. I’m going to continue doing this, but I’m going to start back on the protein shakes and weight lifting, as that’s what helped me gain weight (I weighed much less then 130 once upon a time lol).

 I’m below the 5.7% requirement for pre-diabetes, but I don’t even want to get there. I’m going to make these lifestyle changes now, because my sugar level was 5.6 today, so that means I’m damn close to it huh? Once I stick to a better diet mixed with daily exercise, I’m going to do a blood test in mid October and see the results. Because this upward trend of my hemoglobin A1C from last year is gradual, but not something I want to continue.

8,"Hi,

this is a strange and probably dumb question-it just feels that after nearly 15 years as a diabetic new things crop up which I'm at a loss to explain.

I usually don't get enough sleep, and on weekends (and some weekdays) it's typical that i wake up to turn off my alarm and then go straight back to bed and to sleep. I did that this morning when my alarm went off at 7, woke up at 11 the second time, and took my basal/tested and had a bg reading at 28.5

I was in range before bed, (6.3 was the last reading) and I obviously didn't eat or drink in that brief window where i got up and switched my phone off-is this bad habit causing these massive spikes? Has anyone had a similar experience? 

If it has any bearing I get the dawn phenomenon **a lot**\-like one day a week minimum, and it's an ongoing struggle since I'm usually very tired until midday. Also a caffeine abuser until very recently, and while i want to get up i sleep through an alarm or just go back to bed as often as not.",diabetes,Dawn phenomenon and oversleeping/sleeping badly,1630864176
9," I’ve lived with Type 1 for a while and have stable management. I’ve always been active but recently I started training for a triathlon which requires longer and longer training sessions. For short ones, I can just make sure I don’t have any insulin on board and go for it. However, I’ve noticed my blood sugar starts plummeting no matter what. I’ll keep my regular basal and go first thing in the morning after eating something small with no bolus, and throughout the session, I’ll need to take sugar every so often with no insulin just to keep my levels regular. It is my understanding not having insulin with those carbs will lead to my body not actually processing it into energy which will lead to bad performance, but my issue is if I inject anything at all for my sugar, I will go low.

Since then I had based my blood sugar level on my glucose which was 89 last time I got my blood taken and never knew it was the a1c level that really counted which I saw today was 5.7 3 years ago. 

My diet since then has not been the greatest (can of soda every day, 2 pints of ice cream a week) including fast food.

I'm a recently diagnosed Type 1.  I take Lantus and a fast acting insulin.  Last night, we had meat loaf and green bean cassarole for dinner.  Around 7.  I took five units fast acting.  A few hours later my blood sugar was 207.  

We settled down for the evening to watch a movie.  My wife got up for bed around 11.  I had taken my lantus around 10:00 or 10:30.  26 units.  I had a coors light, about 5 carbs, laying on the couch.  I started to doze, and when I got up, I had the low blood sugar, unease in my stomach feeling.  I checked my blood sugar: 24.  Profuse sweating, serious confusion, and a couple moments where I felt like I'd pass out.  I immediately drank a pepsi.  Five minutes later, 26.  Another pepsi, 50.  Ate some more and we got it up to 150 and stopped eating, eventually settling at 220 for the night.  Fine.  High is better than coma.

But what's weird though, is that this pretty well mimics a frequent routine.  A beer, similar dinners, etc.  What the heck could have caused it to plummet like that?  Is alcohol really a crap shoot?

I'm 100% positive I took the correct insulins.  One thing I'm wondering: I'm not as consistent with when I take my lantus.  It can vary to between 10:00 - 11:00 or 11:30, though if it varies substantially, I do try and gradually change the range.  Could this be the culprit?  

These lows before bed are quite unsettling.  I will be switching when I take my lantus to the morning.  It shouldn't be hard to set a fixed time, since I work from home.  I will also be asking my endo for an RX for a continuous glucose monitor.  Thanks for any thoughts!",diabetes,Ever had a similar event?,1630852634

https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/obn34k/what_to_ask_new_endo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Update: I wound up maxed out on glimperide at 8mg. It was a massive improvement in how I felt. What I’ve been thinking more or less was proven and that is the lower my BG for sustained periods of time, the better I feel. It was like night and day how much better I felt. Unfortunately, I also suffer from migraines and at that level it made my headaches way worse so I’m back down to 6mg and even that is a little much for my headaches. The 6mg just has nowhere the same effect as 8mg. 

My new Endo  I actually really like and felt heard and she understood and was empathetic. However, she’s a very conservative dr in general, and said, your risk for hypo events is too great and I’m not giving you insulin on symptoms alone. She didn’t have any good solutions beyond that. 

I just sent her some data from a week in July when I tried bumping up to 100-125g of carbs/day (currently at 50-75g/day) while on 6mg. I have plenty of events pushing 275-300 that week. Those events typically take scout 2-3 hours to come down to 140-150. 

She hasn’t gotten back to me yet, but I’m assuming this won’t be enough for her. We talked about doing a “normal” diet for a week to see how truly bad my BG numbers are. I really really don’t want to do this as I will feel like garbage and wind up in bed for a week. But I also don’t want to keep going thru this same song and dance with the drs to get insulin. 

So…im probably going to try doing a 200-300g carb diet for a week and see what happens. Do you have any tips or ideas how to approach it or what to look out for?

I've looked at the [major macronutrients, fibers, sugar substitutes](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/09/measuring-effect-of-low-carb.html), [tortillas](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2021/08/low-carb-tortillas-how-do-different.html), [cereal](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2021/08/testing-blood-glucose-impact-of-low.html), [ice-cream](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2021/08/low-carb-ice-cream-how-do-different-brands-affect-my-blood-glucose.html), breads, and [MSG](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/10/seeing-strange-effects-of-msg-on-blood.html). 

Some of my more interesting results:

* [Hot showers cause a increase in blood glucose for people with diabetes](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/03/final-results-hot-shower-effect-on.html) (community experiment with 8 Redditors)
* [Despite the warning labels, Vitamin C does not cause high glucose readings on my CGM in practical amounts](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/09/does-vitamin-c-really-cause-false-blood.html) (this has been shown in the literature, but the papers are hard to find and the warnings in the CGM instruction make it seem like eating anything with Vitamin C can throw off your results).
* [MSG spiked my blood sugar, but only when eaten with a meal &amp; without insulin](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/10/seeing-strange-effects-of-msg-on-blood.html) (replicated multiple times, but I'd really like to see if this happens to anyone else).
* [Butter significantly slowed the rise in blood glucose, independent of amount used](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/10/effect-of-dietary-supplements-low-carb.html) (slowing was expected, but not the independence on quantity).
* [Insoluble or “indigestible” fiber had a wide range of impact, from near zero to 76% of glucose for resistant wheat starch](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/09/measuring-effect-of-low-carb.html) (known in the literature, but was useful to quantify the wide range of results).

I'm not diabetic myself, but I have family who are. The thing is, we're looking at getting our CDLs, but he's worried him being diabetic may cause him to get in an accident or worse.

He's Type 1, and, while he doesn't manage his sugar well rn, I think he'd be able to if it'd help him get out of our current living environment.

My question is how likely is it that he'll have a low while driving? Is it something he can manage, or is it basically out of his control? He'd be operating heavy machinery, so these questions are important moving forward.

So far, been testing and trying to see good/bad in terms of what spikes me. I bought Duncan Hines Keto Friendly Brownie Mix Chewy Fudge and made it. I took a look at numbers when eating as I ate dinner and then a piece of brownie.

My dinner consisted of: 4oz of lemon garlic seasoned chicken from Target which had 3g carbs and 21g protein (I read protein can impact blood sugar too?), Birds Eye Frozen Oven Roasters Brussel Sprouts &amp; Carrots where I ate 1/2 cup (3/4 cups equates to 7g carbs: 4g fiber, 3g sugar), and 5 slices of peeled cucumber

The dinner does not seem to me like the cause for such a large spike. But I did make brownies and used the normal ingredients of the box mixed with water, 2 large eggs, 3 tablespoons of butter, and 3 tablespoons of avocado oil

\- Started first bite of food at 8:30pm and tested at 119 mg/dL

\- Finished food and started a 3inchesx2inchesx1inch brownie at 8:50 and forgot to test before so

\- Tested at 155 mg/dL at 9:15pm 

\- Tested at 160 mg/dL at 9:38pm

\- Tested at 117 mg/dL at 10:00pm

84,"My brother (41) has a brain tumour (diagnosed in 2008) and epilepsy (his only brain tumour symptom) which has perviously been well controlled as he hasn't had a seizure in 13 years, the brain tumour is stable and until the past few weeks he had no symptoms. He has just been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes when admitted to hospital 3 times over the past 2 weeks suffering from Seizures, Severe headache and hallucinations. His blood sugars were high on his first admission but he did not get diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes until yesterday when they started him on one 500mg  of Metformin daily, rising to two 500mg of metformin is two weeks. Its unclear if the diabetes is the cause of his new spate of seizures and other neuro symptoms

He has been discharged from hospital, my parents were given his medication and a leaflet. They brought him home and fed him a sandwich with cheese and tomato on white bread ( 2 slices) then later a can of Heinz tomato soup with white bread and milk. When I arrived at their house he was having a partial seizure one then another quite soon after each other. We tested his blood with a with a blood glucose monitor it was about 12.5 mol/l  (225.0mg/dl). This was about 3 hours after eating last so it seemed high. We then tested him 90 minutes later and it was still 12.5 mol/l (225.0mg/dl).

I discussed with my parents that he should be having food with a lot less sugar so no white bread or tinned soup. I went to the shop and bought some low carb foods for him to eat over the next few days so things like green vegetables, salad veggies, lean chicken and fish, greek yogurt, oats etc. I did get him some brown rice but suggested my parents give him only a small serving of that. We also said he he should drink more water and that we should check his blood sugar levels before eating and then again an hour or so after until we got an idea of what he was able to eat without it spiking his blood sugar. His blood sugar did eventually reduce to about 8.5 mol/l after about 6 hours of not eating. He did not have another seizure after the seizures when I first arrived.

I don't know if we are doing it right, the hospital gave us no real advice they just said to get a blood test from the doctor every few weeks but we are concerned that the seizures that he has been having are being triggered by his high blood sugar as he already has a low seizure threshold due to the brain tumour. He has lost some sight in his left eye in the past few days. He isn't really well enough at the moment to exercise to lower his blood sugars.

Please can someone advise me on what to do to bring down his blood sugars as best we can and as quickly as we can bearing in mind he can't exercise at the moment. I am guessing this is with a low carb diet. I am not sure if he should do more fat as in a keto type diet as he also has high-ish blood pressure. At the moment his food is low carb and low fat.

How often should we check his blood sugars to ensure they are good, should we test him before and after meals, if his sugars are high should he avoid eating until they come down to some extent? I am also worried about if his blood sugar drops too much as I read that can cause a rebound effect in the early house of the morning raising blood sugars high again. This is often when he has seizures and when his headaches start.

Any advice on what sort of diet he should be eating to lower blood sugars and how to monitor his blood sugar levels would be great. I'm aware that the metformin take a few days to kick in and that he will get more benefit when his dose goes up.

For anyone that has had an OGTT (75g test, not pregnant), how long did you feel bad for? I had mine 11 hours ago and am still nauseated and not wanting to eat and didn't know how long that may last.

I had a 3hr 75g OGTT today (checking glucose and insulin levels) to try to get more information about my blood sugars that seem to be all over the place (50s-200s). It went fine until right at the last draw at hour 3 when I went from fine to suddenly the lab staff asking me if I was sure I was okay because I went extremely pale and every bit of color left my face out of nowhere along with me being shaky, lightheaded, and nauseated. I concerned the staff so much the T1D staff member gave me her juice bc all the lab had was water. Shout out to those employees as they were fantastic and super helpful over the next 1.5 hours it took for me to get my BG stabilized enough that I could actually drive home where they weren't worried about me suddenly passing out. What happened today is very similar to what happens to me after 10-15 minutes of moderate exercise as well. 

I am now worried they (drs) are going to make me to do the OGTT again with readings through hour 4 or 5 since almost all of what happened occurred after the hour 3 draw. Either way, I'm just hoping to get some answers eventually from the doctors.",diabetes,Feeling bad after OGTT,1630627710

44,"Context: I've known several Type II diabetics in my life. Two of my grandparents died from diabetes complications, and I've known others for whom it was extremely difficult. I don't believe I'm anywhere near that point, but my limited experience has me scared. Unfortunately, the doctor wasn't super helpful. 

As the title says, I was recently dianosed with type II diabetes, but I wasn't really given any further information on what to do next. The doctor bascially said, ""have fun with your brand-new chronic condition that makes everything you love poisonous,"" patted me on the butt, and shoved me out the door. 

(I don't have my labs in front of me, but IIRC my A1C is like 6.4. I know that's basically Baby's First Terminal Condition numbers, but see context, above.)

The doctor *did* refer me to a diabetes education clinic, and I'm in the process of setting up a meeting, but who knows when that will be. 

I've tried to change my diet by buying diabetic-friendly snacks ([Bavarian Meats](https://www.amazon.com/Bavarian-Meats-Landjaeger-Hardwood-sausage/dp/B08KSLJK9J/ref=sr_1_5) FTW), switching to wheat bread, brown rice, and coke zero, etc., but I still feel rather scared.  On the one hand, ice cream and white bread are legitimately two of my favorite foods, and I quite enjoyed my full-sugar sodas besides. On the other, I've seen what diabetes can do to people, and I want no part of that life--in fact, browsing memes about insulin prices is a surefire way to trigger a depressive episode. 

Again, I'm in the process of meeting with some professionals to get some guidance, but that won't be for a week, minimum. Could anyone offer any sort of unofficial reassurance or guidance? How scared should I actually be at this point? How drastically do I need to change my lifestyle? And, is it possible / advisable to ""cheat"" on my diet occasionally (My wife and I disagree on this point)?

Okay, hear me out for context: I am not currently pregnant and also not trying to become pregnant. I'm not in a relationship and I don't know if I ever will be much less having kids of my own. I am just.... worried, shaken and overwhelmed.

Quite recently I've changed my endo since the one I visited before was only in for the money he could make by prescribing medications I don't use that are much more money-milking than the one's I rely on (that's another story for sometime). I had said appointment with my new endo and she was absolutely fine, a complete sweetheart listening to what I what, how I feel, how I 'navigate' through this autoimmune disease.

The problem I felt I had was with a dietitian that I also spoke with at that doctor's office. That person randomly started giving me tips on weight loss, fertility and pregnancy with type 1 and I immediately blocked these by saying ""I didn't ask for your input on this and I don't want to elaborate"" since these are highly fragile and personal topics. She stopped after muttering to herself for a little bit but I have become an expert in not-hearing that. 

There's just this one thing that stands out to me. She said ""As a type 1 diabetic, your BG shall never go above 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) when pregnant"". She didn't even point out any impacts on a child coming from a BG higher than 140 mg/dl in pregnancy, she just made the statement and that was it. Maybe it was my fault to not ask for her to explain, but like I said I didn't want to elaborate at this point.

My problem with this is: my body will never ever stay below 140 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/l) for 9 months straight. It's insane, I've recently tried diets which worked for the BG part but I was exhausted and suffering from a heavy lack of energy. This kind of makes me feel like a bad patient plus bad parent and I'm not even pregnant yet and I don't know if I'll ever be.

Can anyone with t1d+having kids - experience tell me if this is normal/true/rightful? Idk. It crushes my heart that my body could be the reason for me to one day ultimately decide to never have kids. And I didn't even plan to have kids in the next 7+ years.",diabetes,Type 1 &amp; pregnancy,1630587602
64,"[27/M] So after heading to the hospital with dizziness, tight chest and throat on the 21st August, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes after my blood glucose levels were recorded as 21mmol/L (I did have a sugary drink not long before they did the test, so it was a little skewed). However, I was told that my insulin levels are still good, and that I can make the diabetes go into remission if I stayed hydrated and lost weight.

Nonetheless, I was prescribed with metformin and gliclazide, and after about a week and a half, my glucose levels have gone down into the single digits (with the lowest reading being 6, and the highest being 9). However, the toll it has taken on my health, especially mentally, has made my life miserable.

Before the diagnosis, I drank 2 2L bottles of soda (no added sugar) every week. I've cut it out entirely, and now, it seems like I have little to no energy throughout the day. I've also changed my diet, and while having meals does perk me up temporarily, it's not long before I crash again. 

I've also started taking brisk walks around my town to build up an exercise regime. Before the diagnosis, I weighed just under 23 stone, and I barely moved my body, let alone exercise (oops). The exercise is nice, and offers a brief respite from the misery I'm facing.

By far the worst thing I'm suffering from though is anxiety. After the diagnosis, it feels like I'm anxious nearly non-stop. I had a couple of panic attacks per day during the first week, and I'm still getting them even now. My heart feels tense nearly all the time, and I keep having to take deep breaths every so often, which is affecting my sleep, since every time I feel like I'm going to fall asleep, my heart suddenly tenses and wakes me up. I only got 4 hours of sleep last night.

I also get weird feelings of numbness in my hands and my face (although the face numbness has got better in recent days). I also get a tight chest on occasion, which can make breathing a bit of a struggle.

I also seem to get a tight throat when I take the metformin. The feeling hits a few minutes after I take the tablets, and it becomes a bit tricky to hold my head up. The feeling does subside after a few hours, but I'm wondering if this is a side effect at all.

I've been to my doctor, who has told me that all these things I'm feeling are due to my anxiety, and that other than my weight, I'm actually rather healthy (urine and blood tests showed nothing wrong, and the ECG showed nothing abnormal either). He's referred me to a local group that can provide CBT, and I'm just waiting for them to call. 

Still, it's hard not to think that every little feeling in my body is my diabetes slowly killing me, and my physical health is suffering because of it. I'm writing this to ask if anyone else was in the same boat when they first got diagnosed, and if it all gets better eventually, because I won't lie: I'm scared.

Coming up on my third surgical intervention on my right foot. Fifth metatarsal completely compromised and also a pathological fracture in #5. 3, 4 and 5 toes gone a few years back, debridement a few months ago, didn't help, now I have a raging osteo infection. Been dealing with a reopening wound ever since surgery in 2019, suspected it's caused by internal infection flaring up.

Living in a small town that treats mostly sedate elderly people, I'm nervous about getting treated here. Late July I expressed concern my foot didn't feel right after debridement. Simple  X-ray was taken, didn't show anything spectacular. Finally got appointment with Ortho that did the debridement back in end of May, he spent maybe one minute looking at x-ray, says yeah looks fine, don't need to worry. Few weeks later foot is badly swollen, incision site from debridement has become open wound. 

Wound specialist orders strong oral antibiotics and MRI, do the scan a week later. Results back full blown osteo in three metatarsas plus bad cellulitis. Wound specialist called Ortho directly on personal cell phone. Ortho office calls me oh sorry Dr doesn't have any openings until late October but will try to call you directly.

Week later, crickets.

In the mean time also been trying to involve my new PCP, my previous PCP quit, left town. PCP office says oh, can't see you until November. Call them back, please get me in sooner or at least arrange virtual visit / phone call - crickets. Sent message to PCP directly using the health portal. Get a call a day later from some assistant, Dr wants to know specifically what my concerns are, so he didn't actually read my message as I wrote out my concerns. I told them my concern is a fracture and active infection, what are my treatment options, why is no one talking to me... Assistant says oh well, Dr will review your chart. Assistant calls back later in the afternoon, Dr still won't see me, but is going to call my wound specialist. 

Haven't heard back. Meeting with wound specialist again tomorrow.

Strongly debating getting my house stuff squared away, giving my dog over to friends and packing light and driving to ER in a bigger city with maybe more competent staff.

Really frustrated that no one at my hospital will talk to me except for my wound care nurse. He's been awesome through all this but he's not a surgeon, and not an internal medicine specialist.

82,"My daughter was 4 last week and was diagnosed T1 in early May. 

We worked with our diabetes nurse for the first few months to adjust the doses or her rapid insulin (Novorapid) and Basal Insulin (Tresiba). We ended up with her on only 1 unit of Tresiba per day and 0.75/1/1.25 units of Novo per 10g of carbs for breakfast/lunch/dinner. This of course did not work perfectly as she is so young and the hot weather really affects her, but it was not too bad most of the time. Her dexcom app showed her in range on average around 70% and at one point we got it to 89% over 2 days.

We had our first appointment with the consultant and she immediately said the ratios are wrong, that the Tresiba should be higher and Novo lower, so told us to adjust them. She seemed to base this on theory rather than any analysis of her glucose levels.

After a brief period where this seemed to work it is now chaos, mostly at might. We started having to give snacks before bed to stop nighttime hypos, which never happened before, and now these are not enough and she is having hypos (sometimes 2) most nights even after a snack. Then some nights she is crazily high all night due to the snack.

We have no idea what to think. We know the honeymoon period has likely ended and that her age and rapid growth etc is a big factor. But it seems like we can control it better with lower basal and more rapid insulin. The nurse, who knows our daughter well, agrees with this, but it goes against what the Dr said.

Are there recommended ratios for rapid/slow insulin?

Are there are issues with too much rapid insulin for a small child (even if it is keeping her glucose in range well)?

91,"Hello all,

I have been diagnosed with diabetes three months ago exactly. My A1c was 12.6% and a fasting BG of 4.25 mg/dl (23.6 mmol/L). 

The diagnosis was a Type 1 because:

* I'm male 34 years old.

* I went from 200 lbs to 163 lbs in a couple of weeks. (BMI of 30.1 to 24.4 ).

I had high ketones at the times, so I was sent into the ER and was given an IV and insulin. I was discharged two days later. 

My doctor prescribed me insulin (rapid and slow acting insulin) and was asked to do anti body tests to confirm the T1 diagnosis. 

The problem was the anti body tests and c-peptide tests were expensive and were sent overseas (I live somewhere in Africa). I didn't have the money for the tests, nor for the insulin. 


Three days after diagnosis, I started on low carb high fat diet. The very next day, my fasting BG was down to the 80s mg/dL (4.4 mmol). 

I realized I could manage this with a low carb diet, and take it one day at a time. 

Today, it's been exactly three months since my first diagnosis. I went in for an A1c and I got a result of 5.1%. 

**I understand that this is the  honeymoon phase, and I'm probably putting the few beta cells I have left on a fast line to the slaughter house, and that I will need to be put insulin at some point in the near future.**

Now, this is where I need your help. I have been cheating on my diet the last couple of weeks. 

I discovered that I had gallstones. Gallbladder attacks left and right the last couple of weeks because of the high fat in my diet. Doctor told me to get the gallbladder out asap, but then it comes down to money again, and I can't afford the surgery. 

The solution? A strict low fat diet. 

The problem, is I'm on a low carb diet to manage the diabetes, now I had to cut the fat completely so that my gallbladder doesn't implode. 

That was manageable the first week, but then my energy took a hit, I couldn't live on protein alone. I started cheating on my low carb diet. 

I would eat something high in carbs in the morning, two hours later, I check my BG and my meter tells me it's at 140s mg/dL (7.8 mmol), sometimes as high as 180 mg /dL (10 mmol). I go for a 20 minute fast paced walk, get home, drink lots of water, and my BG is down to low 100s mg/dL or even 90s mg/dL (5 mmol, 5.6 mmol). So three to four hours after a high carb meal, my BG is back to normal. 

By doing the above, am I sitting myself up for complications? Does having high spikes of BG for three to four hours put me at risk of developing complications?",diabetes,"A1c from 12.6% to 5.1% in three months. Details and timeline inside. Please read, I need your help.",1630513060

The last few times I've gone swimming, I've eaten shortly afterward since it's early evening by the time I am done. It's usually around 6 or 630 that I finish and eat. 

My sugar readings after workout have been in the 120-130's prior to working out and 90's prior to eating. They rise to around 170 to 200 after eating. I take my evening meds (500mg Metformin and 1 tablet of Glimepiride) with the food.

About 2 to 3 hours after that I find myself plummeting into the 70's and lower. Once I go under 70 that's when I start to panic and start having some sugars. Lowest I've dropped was 60ish and I know that's dangerous.

His brother passed away from a heart attack over a decade ago and his sister experienced a heart attack just a couple of years ago. My dad had always been wary of his condition and has taken some measures such as medication and changing his diet to some extent but he wasn’t very committed. He has been a chain smoker since he was a teenager and smoke around 5 packs a day. He also drinks a lot of caffeine and has a very poor sleeping schedule. Despite this, he’s always been in pretty good shape since he regularly exercises.

Just two months ago, he had a heart attack when he was overseas and had to be brought back home on emergency. He said he barely felt anything besides a slight chest pain but the doctor explained that he had suffered a near fatal attack and showed the internal scarring to us as well. It could have killed my dad, had he not been regularly attempting to keep active. The doctor also mentioned that his blood sugar and cholesterol is super high and needs to be properly managed. His increased blood sugar levels is causing blood to leak into his eyes slowly, deteriorating his vision over time as well. My dad now faces the possibility of going blind if death doesn’t catch up to him first.

Since then, he’s been pretty shut off. He’s taking his medications regularly and he’s stopped smoking but I think he’s scared and frustrated that he can’t control his blood sugar levels.

A new University of Kentucky College of Medicine study suggests that time-restricted eating may be able to help people with Type 2 diabetes reduce nocturnal hypertension, which is characterized by elevated blood pressure at night.

&amp;#x200B;

The study published in PNAS June 22 found that time-restricted eating, a routine in which eating is restricted to a specific window of time during each day, helped prevent and improve diabetes-related nocturnal hypertension in mice.

&amp;#x200B;

Study authors Ming Gong, Ph.D., M.D., professor in the Department of Physiology, and Zhenheng Guo, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, are hopeful their findings will mean time-restricted eating could offer similar benefits for people.

&amp;#x200B;

""We are excited about these findings and the implications they could have in future clinical studies,"" said Guo. ""In addition to lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, time-restricted eating could have a healthy impact on people with Type 2 diabetes.""

&amp;#x200B;

Normally, blood pressure falls at night and increases upon awakening, in line with the body's circadian rhythm. In some hypertensive patients, the typical nighttime decrease does not occur. This ""nondipping"" blood pressure is prevalent in patients with Type 2 diabetes and is associated with increased events of cardiovascular disease.

&amp;#x200B;

The study found that imposing time-restricted feeding prevented diabetic mice from developing nondipping blood pressure. The practice also effectively restored the disrupted blood pressure circadian rhythm in mice that already had nondipping blood pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

Researchers restricted the mice's access to food to eight hours during their typical active awake times every day. When food availability was increased to 12 hours, the practice was still effective in preventing and treating nondipping blood pressure. Guo says this is evidence that the effects were caused by the timing of feeding and not calorie restriction.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the study's significance for future clinical research in people, Gong says it's adding to scientists' understanding of the causes and mechanisms of nondipping blood pressure in diabetes, which is currently not fully understood.

&amp;#x200B;

""There are already many studies that show the health benefits of time-restricted eating, particularly for metabolic issues,"" Gong said. ""This is the first basic science research focused on how it impacts nondipping blood pressure related to diabetes and it reveals that the daily timing of food intake could play a critical role.""",diabetes,Time Restricted Eating Improves Health of Type 2 Diabetics,1630498429

 Then 1 hour after i have 230 BG out of fucking nowhere! And i say ok, around 4 hours the effects of previous insulin are gone, so lets take 2 units to get to normal levels. Then just before i go to sleep, 66 BG..

My last 3 months have mostly been one big meal once a day. Could that have caused a normal A1C since my glucose would have been sub 100 for probably 12-16 hours a day? She was really confused by that and is sending me for bloodwork tomorrow. I know they have to test for kidney/liver function before metformin anyway but would anything on that panel help show why I am seeing these massive post meal spikes when I eat carbs?

34,"I'm posting this at risk of sounding like a total idiot, but when I look this stuff up on google, I find all sorts of bs suggestions ranging from obvious stuff like food without carbs to stuff I've literally eaten in the past when I was hypo to raise my BG (i.e. Blueberries). So I'm gonna ask this here. 

As a type 1 diabetic, what kinds of non-meat foods can I eat reasonable portions(*) of without taking any insulin? I'm talking stuff that might make my BG rise by 40/50 units max, such that my basal insulin will take care of it before my next meal. I'd prefer foods that just so happen to be low carb over stuff that's specifically advertised for diabetics since that tends to be pricier, though if it's good it's good. Just want some ideas really so I don't have to jab myself as often. Some meal ideas too would be great. 

* a reasonable portion of rice would be a full bowl, a reasonable portion of berries will absolutely not be 3 berries, etc.",diabetes,Any food I can eat without a bolus?,1630442360
35,"Ok so to give this some perspective, i have never eaten properly, not really anyway. And this goes back to my youngest memories. I am just one of those people that absolutely hate vegetables and most fruits. It isnt even always a taste issue, its texture. I can recall being even a small kid and growing up in the days of ""clean your plate or you dont leave the table"". I would save my milk to the end of the meal so i could wash down corn or peas like pills. If i chewed them i would gag and throw up. And that same gag reflex happens even now. I can maybe handle a bit of iceberg lettuce because it has some crunch to it, but none of the leafy spinach or that stuff. 

So since being diagnosed i have tried to make minor changes to me eating habits But i just cant handle the vegetables. Between the whole gag thing and nerve damage to my gut doing so also gives me terrible diarrhea. So when i read this forum alot of times it seems like people are stressing diet (which i do understand) but make it seem like IF you BG is under control with medications that is some how less desirable of an outcome. 

When i was first diagnosed my a1c was hovering somewhere around 12 they said. currently it floats around upper 5s to low 6s, normally about 5.8-6.2. Most of this gain i attribute to medication. Humulin N and R and i take Glipizyde 2 times a day. I have changed my eating somewhat but more minor things. Like if the family is having hambergers or hotdogs skipping using buns onj mine. If we are doing pasta skipping the garlic bread and trying to have a bit less in my portion etc. 

So i guess my question is that i seem to be able to keep my a1c in a range that most people here seem to say is decent, but i am doing it through more medication then diet which seems to be frowned upon. Is there a real difference i guess is what i am asking. Let say i suddenly can take leafy greens or more vegetables, is it any different health wise to reach the low a1c from diet then it is medication?

My 6am blood glucose readings are almost always in the 130's.  10-15% higher than my bedtime reading on average.

My question is, should I be taking the basaglar at bedtime instead of the mornings to combat what I'm guessing is dawn phenomenon?   

Knowing me, I'm overthinking things.  But if that minor change could help my morning readings and/or allow me to reduce the basaglar, I'd be all for it.

96,"Best tip for every Freestyle Libre user: **get xDrip to upgrade your Freestyle Libre from a FGM to CGM**. For me, this has massively improved my quality of life (big thanks to this guy in the gym who spotted my sensor &amp; tapped on my shoulder to share this tip!). Forwarding this here, since this community has been of massive help since my diagnosis.

**My setup**  
What I'm doing now is use *xDrip* for continuous monitoring via the Libre sensor, then collect this data in *Apple* *Healthkit* and *Nightscout*. Then I use the *Nightguard* app to read from *Nightscout*, to show my readings on Apple Watch as a native complication. My partner also uses *Nightguard* to follow my readings remotely. Then with the *Sugarmate* app, which reads from Apple Healthkit (and Nightscout), I can combine this data with e.g. carbs intake captured with *MyFitnesspal*. *Sugarmate* even provides a Mac app to show your current level in your status bar, which is super useful while at work.

You can get XDrip for iOS via Testflight: [https://xdrip4ios.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://xdrip4ios.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
OR download the APK for Android: [https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus)

Call me a geek (yes, I am), but this setup has made my life so much better. I might simplify it a bit later on, but so far so good. Still playing around with alerts (pref. xDrip since this does not require an internet connection). Still a bit cautious with apps that don't leverage the 'critical alerts' feature in iOS that overrides all focus modes and silencing.

**Question for those who also have this running:** have you found a way to upload your xDrip / Nightscout / Sugarmate data to LibreView/LinkUp, for your doc to follow? They only seem to support importing from the Libre Reader or app, no API seems available. And any suggestions for managing alerts? Also big like for Sugarmate's notify feature, which calls you if going low and texts emergency contacts if going way too low (thresholds can be configured).

(Note: zero medical disclaimers here, everything is experimental, reading can be a bit delayed, xDrip is not officially approved or regulated for diabetes therapy and/or treatment in any way whatsoever).",diabetes,Libre + xDrip + Nightscout (+ Sugarmate?),1630346944

I'd \*like\* to use the dexcom G6, as I understand has better readings, works better with a pump if I get one, good stuff. The problem with them is that I can't run their software on my phone cause I don't have one of the ones they approve, which is complete bullshit imo, there is no technical reason any modern android can't run that app, just some corporate circlejerk imo.   

     
The only other one I've really found that is as easy to wear as the G6 is the freestyle libra, but from what I've read on those, it may as well be a standard checker because it only gives a reading when you scan it, so I'm not too keen on spending more on something that really doesn't do anything new and just makes me uncomfortable. 

And lastly I've more recently heard of Medtronic, but they have the exact same problem as dexcom, the phone garbage.

I've been wondering the answer to this question for some time, but have never managed to find a solid answer. Almost every article says ""long periods"" of high blood sugar cause damage, but how long exactly? How soon does high blood sugar begin to damage the body?

I ask this because of some recent trouble with my blood sugars. I'm type 1, but have recently had higher sugars than usual. I think I've managed to stay on top of them, as I will check frequently throughout the day and never finish the day with levels above 7, but for a couple hours it is clear that I've had levels above 10, meaning I quickly take a correction dose after I've checked.

It's just that when I see those high numbers, I can't help but worry about the damage? Particularly damage to blood vessels and nerves.

I woke up this morning and my sugar was beautiful. Ate a bowl of multigrain Cheerios and I started to do some baking. Maybe an hour in and I start to feel like shit. Checked and it jumped to 13. So I guess cereal is just not going to work for me anymore. I tried different kinds especially the ones with lower glycemic index but it still jumps me so I guess it’s just not going to work. My worries about keeping my sugars in check have been multiplied by the fact that I’m pregnant. Being type 1 always brought anxiety about having complications during pregnancy to the point that I promised myself not to get pregnant unless I was on the pump and cgm.

I then spent 3-4 hours making a cake because me and my partner were visiting his grandparents. They live in the same town but we don’t visit too often for reasons. Usually bringing baked goods stops them from picking us apart. My sugars also came back down to 5.4 so I was feeling much better and thought I could handle them. 

We get there and I started cutting up the cake but I knew that I messed up as soon as I cut into it. It must have fallen or something because it was tough. I take one bite and the grandma says “you can’t eat sugar!”. 

Then for the next half hour she states that I can’t have cake. Invasive grandparents are worsened by Alzheimer’s by a long shot. Especially if they already had a habit of even telling thin girls they are too fat before the disease sets in. 

My mood plummeted and I was ready to cry. She then asks “is the baby overweight???????”
I wish I could say at that moment “bitch! The baby isn’t even born yet! Fuck off! You don’t know a fucking thing about health so keep your nose out of it!”

Course I bit my tongue because there’s no point in trying to reason with someone with Alzheimer’s and I know that I am doing everything I can to control my bs. But I needed to leave because I felt awful. My partner said that we needed to leave because I was visibly tired and he needed to do some errands. He noticed that I was having a hard time and found an excuse to leave. 

He tried everything to bring my mood up and I cannot be luckier for that. I just wished it was enough to remove all of the frustration and pain I was feeling. I’m working so hard to keep my growing baby healthy and it’s not enough. It hurts that this baby is already being ridiculed just because I have a disease that I had since I was 6. 

 I’m paranoid that they are going to be body shamed just like I was. Being ridiculed for my weight when my body was so tiny from the dka when I was diagnosed really messed me up. This trailed into my adulthood and caused an 8 year long eating disorder. Well probably not the only factor but a big one.

Admittedly my mood hasn’t been great before all this but today was just too much. I wasn’t being attacked, my baby was and I was the reason. I know things are like that as parents but I emotionally just couldn’t handle it today.",diabetes,Just having a bad day,1630223179

We can control type 2 diabetes by following a diet that is low in fat, low in sugar, low in salt, and high in fibre. It should consist mainly of plants and other foods with low glycemic index numbers, and be washed down with lots of water.

There are times however, no matter how successful we are at controlling our diabetes, that we experience ‘unexplainable’ swings (up or down) in our blood glucose levels.

The reason is simple: we all have slightly different reactions to various foods, ie some foods will increase (or decrease) blood glucose levels for some people while others will experience no effects, adverse or otherwise, from eating these foods.

To become adept at controlling our diabetes we need to know how we are affected by particular foodstuffs and drinks. We can only find this out by keeping track of our responses to them.

To help, here are some notes on various foodstuffs and drinks that may affect your blood glucose levels in various ways. You should [check these tips for controlling blood sugar against your own experience of how these particular foods affect you](https://healthline.blog/top-16-tips-for-monitoring-and-controlling-blood-sugar-levels/).",diabetes,16 Tips for Controlling Blood Sugar Levels,1630163826

""Being ill can make your blood sugar go all over the place. Your body tries to fight the illness by releasing stored glucose (sugar) into your blood stream to give you energy. But your body can’t produce enough or any insulin to cope with this, so your blood sugars rise.""

I wish i asked them to do a full panel blood test. I originally thought it might be the side effects. it had nothing to do with the vaccine.  What really was to blame was long term (2 years) Metformin daily 2000mg use along with going on a partial plant based diet. 2 days a week i would have eggs.  Supposedly, my Vitamin B12 was very low.  I wasnt supplementing because i didnt know any better. nobody tells you.  i felt so weak. my arms were tingling, and my skin was so irritated. my fingers and toes went numb and cold and then came the heart palpitations, bp was off the charts, then came chills, sweats, and lots of shaking.  this lasted for 3 weeks after my Covid shot. i took myself off metformin temporarily 2 days ago and just continue using insulin. immediately saw improvement. supposedly, its well known that the drug causes absorption issues of b12.  has anybody experienced this?",diabetes,Metformin and Low Vitamin B12 Levels,1630110753

I've been covered by Medi-Cal for as long as I can remember, but a potential upcoming Income change could get me booted off so I wanted to research my options before hand.

Some Obligatory information:

* Test 3-4 times daily with Bayer Next Strips
* Use a Medtronic Insulin pump so Supplies would have to be covered.
* Use Admelog (after being switched from Apidra)
* Have a Medtronic CGM. I don't use it too heavily so just a bonus if its covered.
* Visit doctors once every 3-6 months and usually no ER unless extremely serious

My doctor said not to be too worried about it because my other tests were normal, but I still wanted to take it seriously. I ate a ton of junk food from 2017-2021. I immediately stopped all of that and went low carb. I lifted weights/did cardio around 4 times a week and continued that. 

July: 87 fasting and 5.2 A1C (blood draw)

August: 99 fasting and 5.3 A1C (blood draw). 

I've done my own testing with a Contour Next meter. My typical day looks like this: 

Morning: high 90s - mid 100s (usually higher around morning vs pre lunch at noon)

post lunch (low carb): 1&amp;2 hours: low 100s - high 100s (occasionally 1 hour is in 110s)

3-5 hours post lunch highs 90s - low 100s

6+ hours post lunch, before dinner: high 80s or low 90s, typically my lowest measurement of the day 

I'm not really sure what to make of all this. I'm concerned that the prospect of LADA because I have a normal weight, have tried keto/low carb, and am still right at that pre-diabetic fasting level.

It hasn’t felt like very long but it’s been 6 months since my initial diagnosis earlier this year and I’m finally eligible for a pump! Everything has been squared away and I’m getting the MiniMed 770G with the Guardian sensor and wanted to ask if anyone has that system and how they like it?

A few of my more targeted questions if anyone knows the answer:

- Does having the Guardian sensor allow your pump to give insulin based on your current readings like the t:Slim? I know when I spoke to the representative on the phone they said the sensor and pump work together so will it ask to give me more insulin or stop giving me insulin for a period of time based on my glucose?

- Do the infusion sites hurt more than manual injections? I’ve accidentally jabbed my pen in the softer parts of my stomach and it’s definitely not a pleasant feeling, but I was wondering if pump site injections are more painful or around the same level?

- Does the pump help keep your glucose at a steady range? I know if I occasionally indulge myself with something sweet, even if I give my insulin a head start I can spike a little so does the continuous flow help keep those spikes to a minimum?

16,M 5’11 142lbs. I’ve had abdominal pain/gi problems for 12 months. Only thing that was found was gastritis. Have had a burning mouth issue the past 3 months. Recently I noticed white stuff on my tongue and went to urgent care. They gave me 1 week of nystatin for thrush and checked my blood glucose(it was normal). My mouth still burns so I decided to monitor my glucose levels. 2 hours after eating 100 carb meals i was 140-150 every time. 158 2 hours after panda(chowmein and honey shrimp)was my highest. The past 7 days when I’ve woken up my glucose has only been over 100 twice(105 and 102). In the middle of the day my glucose has been as low as 78 and in the mid 80s on multiple occasions. So I went to my doctor and told her this info. She did an A1C and it was 5.3. She said I’m fine and told me to stop googling stuff and not to check my glucose levels. I feel like that’s not what I should do so I ate 160 carbs to see what would happen. After 1 hour I was 171. I didn’t check or eat again for 6 hours. It was 93. I then ate bbq wings and 178 was the highest I seen after 45 min. I feel like the doctors advice is poor.

This last Saturday I go and get my blood drawn for them to run the numbers.

Today I got a call from my doctor telling me that my numbers are very high and they need me to come into the office tomorrow so that we can get me on medication as soon as possible. 

For the first few hours after the call I felt I was handling it very well. I also have a history of anxiety attacks and was surprised that I didn't have any.

I live alone. If I were to say fall into a diabetic coma it would be several hours before anyone realized something was wrong, like my coworkers realizing I didn't show up for work. 

From my understanding someone who has fallen into a diabetic coma can recover if they are found within a short time, but anything beyond an hour or two could result in severe brain damage and death.

44,"I’m not really sure what I should be doing. Maybe I should push to see an endocrinologist? My last blood lab I had a fasting glucose of 123 mg/dL and my A1C was at 4.7%. 

However, when measuring at home, upon waking up, I’m always below 90. I tested for a week and it ranged from 71-88. 

I have not gotten retested yet since the last 123 lab result, but assume that testing a single time above 100 mg/dL is conclusive of issues with me being insulin resistant.

However I’m a bit concerned. My dad is prediabetic. I’m 23 years old, normal weight, even have some muscle. 

I’m really concerned about the 123 result as that signifies I’m borderline diabetic and clearly prediabetic. But my A1C (lab) and measured fasted glucose levels (at home) are normal. 

Something isn’t adding up, and I feel confused. I want to know for sure if I’m prediabetic and should start changing up my diet or not. I’m already eating healthy but that includes carbs like overnight oats and fruit and brown rice. 

I also followed Alan’s guide to testing and my results at 1 hour and 2 hours are normal (both below 140 for a heavy carby meal).

Her rants are entertaining, her hot takes are funny and she is refreshingly honest about the perspective that Type 1 has brought to her life. 

Here's a good starting point (and then episode web page has links to her various social feeds)

Imagine this: you’re young, active and healthy, with ambitious goals. Then, suddenly, you have to rethink it all when you receive a life-changing health diagnosis. How do you come to terms with it? How do you keep pushing forward? That’s exactly what Taylor Efford—a Toronto-based content creator, comedian and actor with a large social media following—had to confront last year when, at 25 years old, she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Instead of carrying on like nothing had changed, she discovered a renewed strength and sense of purpose, sharing her journey with her followers to raise awareness about the disease. This week, she sits down with Dr. Jack Muskat, clinical director of mental health at Medcan, to talk about her story.

55,"So, to cut to the chase, my GF and I are hardcore cyclists. She's a T1, and for years i've been trying to come up with a way of displaying her glucose numbers in realtime on something handlebar mountable (no phone, it wouldn't last 10 seconds on a real DH track). Rooted Sony Smartwatches and anything else you can think of. Even contacted the head of Wahoo, who wrote a custom firmware for his computers for the Novo Nordisk cycling team in order for them to have a live reading.

Having to stop during a high tempo road ride, or pull off to the side in the middle of a downhill descent to check blood sugar always ruins the flow, and I want to try and prevent this.

Well fast forward to now, and Supersapiens, who are using the Freestyle Libre 2 to show BG on their activity watches and cycling head units, seems to solve all my problems! Until I asked them what the possibilities are... They say that the app, and therefore the value forwarding to the head unit, is only compatible with the Supersapiens Activity glucose monitor. Shit. Sounds like they lock it out in the firmware of the sensor despite being mechanically identical.

What are the chances somebody using a FL2 wouldn't mind downloading the Supersapiens app and seeing if you can connect? I'd do it myself, but my GF needs to make an appeal to her insurance as to why she needs an upgrade to the 2. Her birthday is coming up and I was hoping to buy her the Garmin in time for that!

Mom's side: Aunt was Type 1, but died of a hypoglycemic coma at 12. Grandmother was Type 2, died of a heart attack I think at 45? Could've been 42-47; I'm no longer in contact with my mother for other reasons so I have no way to verify. Mother has never had pre/diabetes AFAIK.

*I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS*

So I've been having some pretty severe nausea after eating pretty much anything for several years now; but previously chalked it up to indigestion. On 8/16, I actually vomited after a meal and subsequently freaked out and thought I was pregnant: I'm not, three tests later. 

I had been running to the bathroom a lot, so I made an appointment with a CVS minute clinic for a diabetes screening, but wasn't able to do a fasting glucose test or an OGTT since I had been eating small bits every couple of hours to try and combat the weight loss. She did a finger stick at 15:30 after I'd been asleep with no food since 8:30, and my BG was 106mg/dl. 

The nurse said I was fine, and couldn't explain my symptoms; so we did a urine culture and ketones test as well. Ketones were negative, but urine culture came back positive for a UTI. It's a damn good thing I got tested; because if this is what a UTI feels like I've had about 4 in the past six months that haven't been treated. I literally can't tell. I'm on antibiotics now, which were started after my home OGTT (script wasn't filled yet/results took 3 days) so I know they didn't affect the results.

I didn't believe I was fine, so I went out and bought myself a ReliOn Premier Classic, lancets, and test strips. I've been testing when I wake up, and right before a meal. I was also testing at 1 and 2 hours post prandial, but realized I was missing my peak spike at about 30 minutes into a meal. I'm also trying to eat more carbs to avoid messing with the OGTT, my PCP recommended 100 -150g a day. Here are some numbers for ya-

8/20/21 

@ 12:52 112mg/dl or 6.2 fasting since 8:30
 Progresso vegetarian vegetable w/ barley (this is actually something that's never made me feel too sick after eating it, so this result is interesting)
41g carbs, 10g sugar, 7g protein

@13:52 122mg/dl or 6.7

@14:52 143mg/dl or 7.9

@19:36 125mg/dl or 6.9
¼ cup white rice with butter and salt, started @ 19:45 and finished at 20:00

@20:45 151mg/dl or 8.3

@21:39 124mg/dl or 6.8

I've got more, I just want to avoid making this already long post any longer. I also spiked to 174 at one point from less than 20 bites of rice, corn, and Rotel; which has been a regular meal for a while.

8/23/21.    Home OGTT Results

Last food was actually the rice described in last paragraph, gave up eating from nausea before I thought to check my sugar. Consumed from 1:07- 1:28.

@2:39 131mg/dl or 7.3

@4:02 119mg/dl or 6.6

@6:42 117mg/dl or 6.5
Weight: 94.8

@15:29 111mg/dl or 6.2
75g sugar suspended in 1c water

@15:59 193mg/dl or 10.7

@16:29 219mg/dl or 12.2

@17:15 I couldn't hold it anymore and got up to use the bathroom

@17:29 125mg/dl or 6.9

@18:29 87mg/dl or 4.8
This is actually the lowest number I've ever seen. I was also super hungry and my hands were shaking.

Because of those numbers and how I've been feeling after apparently high carbs meals, I did some research into reactive hypoglycemia; and I wanted to see what other people in this lovely community thought.

82,"So, last night was pretty awful.  Control-IQ tried its best to kill me but I survived to tell the tale...

&amp;#x200B;

At around 12:30 AM last night, I had an unexpected low.  I'm not sure why.  My theory is that it was a pressure low.  I'm not certain, but it's entirely possible.

&amp;#x200B;

At around 1:05 AM, I shot back up.  Could have been a pressure low and I rolled over.  Could have been my liver trying to save me.  Something changed that addressed the low.  I did not eat anything.  It happened so fast, my alarm didn't even wake me up.

&amp;#x200B;

At around 1:10 AM, Control-IQ decides that with my current trend, I'm going to be over 160 within the next 30 minutes.  It decides to crank up the basal.

&amp;#x200B;

At around 1:20 AM, Control-IQ decides that with my current trend, I'm going to be over 180 within the next 30 minutes.  It decides to save the day and gives me 5 units.

&amp;#x200B;

**BUT**, Control-IQ was so wrong.  Very nearly *dead* wrong.  Presuming this was a pressure low, I leveled off almost immediately.  Control-IQ turned up my basal when I was about 75.  It gave me 5 units when I was about 120 as a correction bolus.  The basal increase alone trended me downward.  And when the bolus kicked in, I was already low.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, I woke up a sweaty mess and found some snacks.  There's a really good chance that this could have ended much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I have **zero** confidence in trusting Control-IQ when I'm asleep.  I'll use it during the day when I can monitor it.  But I'm scared to turn it back on tonight so I'm planning on turning it off when I'm asleep.

Dr started me on Metformin which seems to be working well, my A1C six months later was down to 5.8. However, I started reading about LADA and I'm wondering if it's worth getting tested for antibodies to see if I might be type 1.5.

I work an hourly retail job. I’m allowed a 30 minute meal break and 15 minute break after that.My mangers are usually pretty good about running the breaks on time but sometimes they’re behind. I’m controlling my blood sugar with my diet so it’s not great for me when they’re not timely. 
we are also allowed 3 absences and/or tardies a month. i want to see if any health related incidents could be excused from this policies.  I’m not sure how to bring these up to my boss. I’m also not sure if there are other accommodations i could/ should ask for. I’m also not sure if i need to provide proof to receive any accommodations. any advice would be appreciated!

I ordered my first ever libre sensor with its reader and received it a couple hours ago. I've been studying the instructions and watching the videos from abbott etc.

Unfortunately I had no heads up about this and now there isn't much I can do but I kinda need to put it on today.

* Contour Next One
* Livongo (through my employer)

So far the readings have been: (I understand that reading differences may occur since these are monitors from different companies):

I’ve been slowly expanding my disaster preparedness supplies and it’s come time to address my diabetes needs.

4) alcohol wipes 
5) Frio cooling case to maintain insulin vial temps

Since being diagnosed 1 month ago I was put on metformin and also lisinopril for blood pressure.  I then started a low carb diet where I eat no more than 50g in any meal and usually more like 15 or 20.  

I only drink water and from 285 I am now 270.  I am hopefully going to continue all the way to 200 where I feel the best as I am pretty thick and muscular.  

Anyway, I am feeling depression because I really love candy and I know it sounds so stupid, but I do not have kids or a wife and only find joy in having a treat like licorice or gummies.  I looked at some sugar free gummies and even a small pack would have 60g of carbs if I ate the whole pack which I know I would.   

I'm trying to understand just how severe it is every time I would eat carbs or candy?  I also love spaghetti and BLTs.  I've had 0 of any of these things for a month now.  

Am I hurting my organs or giving myself future heart disease each time?  Should I completely forego these items and be depressed?  Is there any licorice or candy that is not only sugar free but low carb?

I have a few people in my family who are all type 2 and most of them do not take care of it at all.  They inject insulin and eat what they want.  One of them has already had open heart surgery.  They are in their sixties though.

After the call I get another call from the colleague who'd just phoned in to say that she wasn't coming in because of our other colleague testing positive for Coronavirus (sorry if this is confusing) to which I was surprised as the manager I spoke to hadn't mentioned this to me on the phone 5 minutes earlier and was happy for me to go into work knowing this, which actually made me feel like they're putting business before their staff's health. So I've immediately booked a PCR test and not gone Into work as although I'm double jabbed, I wanted to be safe and protect my family and the elderly customers who come in.

32,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past 2ish months, I've noticed that my body goes through bouts of being really insulin sensitive or my usual sensitivity.

I'm in pretty athletic shape and I've been on a fitness routine where I am lifting 3x a week and doing cardio (basketball) on satrudays. I've been on this routine for a while, so I'd assume that my body should be used to things and my sensitivity levels should be stagnant. I do/did (when I started working out) have less muscle and more body fat than I had in college, but I as am getting slimmer and building up muscle, could this affect my sensitivity?

On workout days I lower my insulin consumption to \~20%. 

Last week I played basketball for a decently long time and it was a bit more intense than usual. I'm now even more sensitive than I usuallly am on my typical workout days. This scares me because that throws off my insulin carb ratio and my correction scale. I've been going to bed with my glucose levels around 180-230 mg/dL just in case it drops a bit.

Is this abnormal or is what I am saying a usual case in the world of diabetes and I am not looking at this objectively?

I've told myself it's unacceptable for me to have BS &gt;180 for more than a couple of hours, and so I get on the correction chasing rollercoaster of taking too much insulin to bring myself down and then having to correct a low and going high again. 

I recently had a mental breakdown over this after a long day of traveling where my BS was &gt;200 for almost the entire day. I felt so exhausted and defeated and it just became too much for me to deal with. It felt like it didn't matter how hard I tried. 

I'm so afraid of having highs because I don't want complications later in life. I am terrified of having my life shortened or hindered in old age because I didn't do a good enough job managing my diabetes while I'm young. But right now it seems like the pressure I'm putting on myself to be perfect all the time is just making me so stressed out that when I have bad diabetes days, I can barely function normally.

Has anyone else struggled with this? Right now I am trying to just let go and not chase my high blood sugars, just let my pump do its thing. But it's so hard. It's hard when you perfectly calculate the carbs in your breakfast and spend the next several hours high regardless. It's hard when every day your body reacts differently to the same things. It's hard to see that sensor line in the high range for extended periods of time.

Previously i had well very controlled bg levels (A1c between 48-53) aside from problems with the dawn phenomenon, with a very active lifestyle (competitive MMA and bodybuilding). Whereas now exercise is a struggle and often leads to sleepless nights due to bg levels being erratic, which is very frustrating due to the amount of effort i have to put into with temp basals and changing boluses before and after exercise.

This along with the technical faults the omnipod some time suffers has made me reconsider. I am wondering if its worth the hassle and high level of exercise preparation needed for exercise on pump right now if its not going to be an improvement to injections. Also made the switch to fiasp from novorapid which hasn't been ideal so far. My aim with switching to pump was an easier life and more freedom which seems to be the opposite of what i've gotten with it so far.

I should also mention that im a bit of an odd case since my diabetes was caused by chronic pancreatitis which has daily effects on my bgs and overall diet. 

On a side note i'm also curious about how NHS funding for my pump would be affected if i was to change back? would i be allowed to go back onto newer pump models in say 5-10 years if they suited me better?  (sorry if this came across like a big rant just need advice :D)

95,"So, I've been a T1D since 2010 and recently switched to a Dexcom G6 CGM. Previously I was just putting holes my fingers and minding my own business, but after a chat with my doc we decided that switching to a sensor would make my life easier - duh.

It is the first 10 days and the sensor stopped ... and it got me thinking whether it is possible to prevent the 2h warmup phase dexcom forces you to wait.

I had a chat with a mate that uses a Libre sensor and he usually puts the new sensor in the day before the old one fails. Now I have a few questions. Can you do the same thing with the dexcom sensors since the transmitter is separated from the sensor? If it is possible, are there any things I have to watch out for? I feel like the sensor without transmitter is prone to damage. Can I prevent the warmup phase completely? Caus I've read that some people talk about still having to wait 65mins.

96,"I had always been told to subtract fiber from the total amount of carbs, and use only the net carbs for determining insulin dose. The idea is that since your body can't absorb fiber, there's no reason to bolus for it.

However, I just noticed [this](https://www.lancastergeneralhealth.org/health-hub-home/2019/september/total-carbohydrates-vs-net-carbs-what-should-people-with-diabetes-count) which says: 

&gt;**If you have Type 1 Diabetes and use an insulin-to-carb ratio:**  
&gt;  
&gt;If fiber is AT LEAST 5g or more, you may subtract HALF the amount of fiber from the total carbohydrates  
&gt;  
&gt;Example: If your food has 20g of total carb and 5g of fiber, you can subtract 2.5g of fiber from the total carbohydrates = 17.5g Total Carb  
&gt;  
&gt;If your food has 20g of total carb and 4g of fiber, you don't subtract anything

I am prediabetic and have a lot of trouble getting blood glucose readings. There are 2 issues for me

1) getting enough blood despite warming my fingers, massaging them, poking on the side. I have read all the advice and still the blood just never is enough and usually just comes out to the sides. All the videos I see the people can actually get a drop. Mine doesn’t look like a drop. Sometimes I try squeezing it and I end up filling half of the strips. I’ve nearly wasted the whole strips box, I’ve never gotten a reading.

2) I have a condition called palmar hyperhidrosis (basically my hands sweat excessively for no reason). I could be doing nothing and my hands are drenched in sweat. If I try to dry it, the sweat comes back immediately. So I fear that this can give me incorrect readings since sweat has salt in it. And I know everyone has sweat but I have an abnormal amount on my hands.

I tried bringing this up to my doctor but because my A1C was 4.7% and I’ve never gotten an official diagnosis, he can’t get me a prescription for the CGM.

69,"*Posting from a new account for more anonymity* 

Hello, people of r/diabetes! So I met with my primary care physician last week about my recent blood work, which was completed shortly after my regular physical last month. A1C is 6.7, which, of course, means I am officially diabetic. 

Backtracking a bit, prior to me knowing this information. I am female, in my late 20’s, and overweight. Have struggled with my weight for basically my whole life. So when the topic of weight inevitably came up at the physical, I mentioned I wanted to start seeing a dietician to help me establish a better relationship with food. Started seeing this person and have had a few sessions since my physical.

Now, when I was discussing the blood work with my doctor, they said that since I was at a 6.7 and it was caught early, they would hold off on writing it in my chart and an basically didn’t diagnose me since I’m working with the dietician. I have a follow-up blood panel in 3 months. Neither diabetes medication or checking my glucose levels came up at all. They told me they didn’t even want me to consider myself diabetic right now, and that I can put in the work to get the A1C down since it’s slightly over the 6.5 baseline diagnosis. I was just told to lay off on the carbs and sugar and work with the dietician more closely.

I had an appointment with my dietician (who, coincidentally is also a CDCES) the following day and filled them in about the bloodwork. Their reaction was *a lot* different. They were critical of my primary for not starting me on meds and suggest I go back and have an Rx written for Metformin as well as glucose monitor. Relayed there are studies out there that primary care doctors are slow to react to diabetes diagnoses. They told me medication will preserve my pancreatic function and essentially slow down the progression, and that management entails a combination of medication, diet, exercise, and monitoring blood sugar.

I also asked my dietician specifically about diet. I know they are against Keto and I’m really not keen on the idea of cutting out carbs entirely. But I know *personally* I should be limiting the amount I eat. They stated I don’t need to be focusing/monitoring the amount of carbs I have/day. We will focus on “regularized eating” and pay attention to my glucose ratings. 

So with all that: I am SO confused!!! I feel like I’ve gotten a lot of conflicting information. I know doctors aren’t perfect, and my primary care physician doesn’t have the same credentials/expertise as the dietician I’ve been seeing. And I want to trust my dietician since they are CDCES. However, I find myself doubting my dietician too! I’ve been slightly skeptical of the dietician even before this, mostly from a compatibility point of view. They specialize in intuitive eating and CBT, and I’m not entirely sure if this is *for me* like I thought it would be.

I’m sure some of you on here have had a similar experience. I’m just looking for insight and clarity since this is all so new to me. Also if you need additional information or have clarifying questions please lemme know!!

87,"Diabetes has run in my family for a couple generations. I'm not the healthiest guy either so I always made sure to use one of my mom's strip once every month or two to just make sure my levels were ok. They always were, which has been a great comfort since I suffer from some insane anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago after routine blood work, my doctor noticed my glucose is always elevated when I have blood drawn (usually in the 160 range). She ordered an A1C test and it was at 6.3%. This shocked me because while I'm not a super healthy stickler I've always had decent numbers. She wanted to put me on Metformin and have me come back in another 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't take the Metformin because I'm terrified of new medicines (I had an interaction 3 years ago with some other medicine that left me too anxious to add new thing to my regimen). I cut out soda and anything that was ""pure"" sugar, i.e. candy, lemonades, etc. I didn't do anything to carbs, and I tried to be careful with desserts. I have a OneDrop meter that I used during those 3 months and my sugar was always high. Fasting (overnight) I would wake up to 120-140, after meals I'd be 160, and a few terrifying times I was in the 270s. I thought I absolutely had developed diabetes and was just incredibly anxious and depressed about it.

&amp;#x200B;

When I had my second blood draw for my A1C, it ended up being 5.1%. I was ecstatic but also incredibly confused. I almost obsessively took my glucose for those 3 months and the app estimated my A1C would be in the 8% range. The doctor was thrilled, said she was glad I didn't need Metformin and that dietary changes worked, and we'd test it every 3 months for the rest of the year to be sure. My mom is a nurse and has an endocrinologist friend I asked questions of, and he said stress pays a way bigger part on blood glucose than most people imagine, and he figured that's what mine was doing. I have chronic panic disorder and generalized anxiety, and a bit of depression thrown in, and it's been quite a year.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt great, didn't pick up any old habits (besides the occasional candy) and haven't been obsessive taking my readings (usually once a week or so, and they've always been in the \~120 range). Yesterday evening I took it before bed and it was 276. My heart dropped. I couldn't figure out why it was happening. Today, I took it a few hours ago (3 hours after dinner) and it was 245. I used a secondary reader and it was 210. Then I took it an hour or so later and it was back at 241.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm baffled! I've been stressed this week pretty bad but nothing worse than last time, as far as I can say. Getting readings like this makes my anxiety skyrocket and I'm worried all over again I'm developing Type 2. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, where the sugar is coming from (carbs and stress?), or what to do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rambling post, but this history and detail is basically to ask...has anyone had any experience with this? How much have you found your mental well-being affecting your physical numbers? What would make my readings high and super high and then end up giving me a normal A1C? Any insight would be great, as I nervously await lower numbers and a reply to my email to my doctor.

88,"I wasn’t feeling well.  I was experiencing neuropathy and also felt generally run down.  I’m not the sort of guy who runs to the doctor, in fact, I wouldn’t go to the doctor when I began this change and so I was flying blind.  


My diet was awful; I was eating like a teenager, or worse.  I was 250lbs.  I lived on pizza and McDonald’s and pasta and sodas – I was wreck.  I had to admit that to myself, and I did.


It was the culmination of sporadic data that I picked up here and there in my attempt to learn why I wasn’t feeling well which sparked my belief that I needed to break from sugar, and massively reduce my carb intake.  So I did.  I did it cold-turkey and I’m sure I’m sure I did everything wrong; I had a very hard detox – I really suffered. 


But I came out of it.  


Only after I went through this experience and began to feel more in control did I let myself get checked out.  That’s when I was diagnosed (T2).  I wasn’t surprised, but I refused meds then.  I began reading my blood, and eating my meter, agreeing with my Dr. to reach a series of goals on my own.   
While I await my next A1c, I am now 168lbs (at 6’1”) - I’m actually “thin” now.  My blood pressure is normal again (for the first time in years) and my diet is managed within the confines of a T2 life.  I am no longer in ketosis, but rather on a restricted carb diet, &lt;50/day, and I’m learning more and more as I go.  


The greatest win is that my detox, as hard as it was, left me indifferent to sweets and carbs.  I don’t need them or want them anymore, and so I won’t go back to the way I was.  I haven’t had a Coke in I don’t know how long.  That’s how I used to begin my days (some have coffee, I had a coke).  I don’t miss it at all.


My greatest sympathy is for our T1s, because they don’t have a choice.  That very idea encouraged me to take advantage of the fact that I do have a choice.  I am enormously grateful that there is something I can do.  And so I’m doing it.


I’m reading in the low 90’s at fasting now, and my post prandial numbers are 120-140.

95,"Any advice, thoughts or personal experiences are welcome.  I am a 23yo female. I had my first baby 5 months ago. About 3 months postpartum, I started not feeling well… at ALL. Extreme fatigue, extremely sleepy. I could hardly sit up on the couch during the day without needing to go lay down. It felt like I had the flu, minus the cough, runny nose, sore throat etc. It just felt like I had been hit by a truck. I would feel like this for a couple days. It would come back every other week or so at random, or if I were outside in the heat at all. One day we even walked a shaded, flat nature trail on a 75 degree day and it triggered this. Just last week, it happened again. Only this time, some new symptoms came with it. On top of feeling like I’ve just been hit by the flu truck, I’ve got dry mouth, extreme thirst, peeing a lot more than usual (probably because I’m drinking so much water). I’ve had a headache every day. I’ve been nauseous. I wake up in the middle of the night with a headache, covered in sweat and a super dry mouth (no, I’m not pregnant again🤣). I finally got myself in to see my doctor because I am just sick of feeling so unwell. She ran numerous tests. My thyroid checked out, my urine seemed fine. All my blood work was normal, except I am slightly low in potassium and vitamin D. She ran a hemoglobin A1C test as well, which I believe measures your average blood sugar levels over the last 3 months (my dry mouth and excessive thirst actually started happening the day after I had this test done). That test also came back normal. At this point, I am stumped. There is no way I feel this unwell for no reason. It has been months and it feels like I just keep hitting dead end after dead end. I decided to ask around to some friends, to see if there’s any possibility this could just be a postpartum thing? Several people said it sounds like I’m dehydrated. How can that be? I have been drinking SO much water. But my mouth has been dry… so idk, maybe I am? Today I decided to up my water intake. I drank probably about 1/3 of a gallon between 8am-1pm (I hadn’t eaten for probably two hours before this). All of a sudden right after my latest few sips, I started to feel really lightheaded. I had to sit down. I started feeling a headache coming on, I got really shakey, my hands were sweating, my brain started feeling really slow. I couldn’t focus and kept forgetting things. After I had laid down for a few minutes, my mouth became super dry again. Took a few more sips of water, nope still dry as the sahara desert. I decided to make some tacos for early dinner. I felt a little better, my dry mouth got a little better. 30 minutes later, dry as the sahara desert again. My grandma has type 1 diabetes, she got diagnosed at the age of 22.

I don't know what to do I live alone with my grandma who is a retired woman with type 2 diabetes, so I have to pay for my pills by my own. The worst part of this is that my grandma always blames diabetes for all her problems with her eyes and headache. I just have 1 eye working so listen to all of this makes me feel really sad and thinking is my life worth something. My mother lives abroad as a US citizen and She's helping me to apply for a visa to live in the us as a inmigrant, how can I tell her that I could be rejected due to this and asking for help when all of this was my fault. I have though of changing some of my life style but I don't like any kind of vegetables and fruits I've never liked and never eaten. I don't know how much will I last even If I get to take metformine. Today I couldn't sleep at all just thinking how this will affect my lifestyle and How my mom is gonna feel about it since She's been paying for my studies and She really wants me to be there in the US with her.

Other symptoms were cold sweats, extreme shivering, numb hands, my skin hurt to be touched in the beginning.

I took an ambulance to the ER.  Blood glucose was 150.  They did a bunch of blood work, took arterial blood gas.  They started IV fluids and insulin.  The gag attacks persisted every 5-10 minutes for about 6 hours.  I was diagnosed DKA and prescribed insulin.

One of the doctors explained it as I'm just at the point where I need insulin but I'm confused because my numbers have been good.  I'm a little bummed out because of the new risk of lows that insulin brings but hopeful that this will prevent further attacks because that was also very scary.

I was supposed to take 10 ml at bedtime, check my glucose only once the morning and titrate up to no more 18 ml , by 2ml every three days. So I followed his instructions, my numbers never went below 350,but I thought it would gradually drop as I went up. then I got a cold and was unable to work out as usual (not covid or flu, but took me out of commission).   Got over the cold and went to a conference in Las Vegas. I ended up injuring my eye but at the same time was having shortness of breath, went to urgent care who then sent me to the ER. I went to the ER to get my eye checked out and they felt like doing some labs. Only for me to get admitted because my glucose was 744, and ..... I had/have pneumonia. I'm still pissed at my doctor as I was following his instructions and I'm still recovering from pneumonia.

Thing is, I still don't take any insulin. My nightly sugar is always around 100, and I try to keep my meals under 150 peak, and 180 at the most. I am really into soccer and that always gives me my worst sugars around 200-230, and then post-soccer I actually need to eat sugar to avoid going low. My a1C went from 12 at diagnosis to now around 5.8 just with a really low carb diet.

Currently on metformin, my endo said it doesn't really do anything for me but that it is a good drug and may be helping so might as well stay on it.

My diagnosis was based on a C-peptide of 1 (on scale of 1 to 3.8 I believe), and a positive GAD test, Islet was negative though.

I've had type 1 diabetes for 6 years now almost 7 and I have had high sugars the WHOLE TIME. There hasn't been a consecutive month or year where I had normal sugars. I'm surprised I'm still living ok.

I've struggled with my weight ever since middle school, (I'm 15 now) and for reference I'm around 5'1 160 lbs and I've tried countless ways to lose weight but nothing around it. 

Recently I've been in worry that I may possibly be insulin resistant and have possible PCOS. My periods have also always been inconsistent (like coming after 2 or 3 months) (I got it recently which made me a bit happy) and I'm fucking tired of it I feel like it's ruining my life.

I feel tired right after I eat, sleep for several hours and cry that I got nothing done useful in the day, and end up wishing I was never born. 

My mood swings have also affected my relationships with people and especially hurting people close to me that I don't want to rant to anyone because I don't feel like they understand me especially with diabetes so I'm here on reddit venting. 

I'm trying to lose weight by going on a calorie deficit and exercising doing a bit of cardio and strength workouts but nothing changes. (Doesn't help that Idk how to cook and having to hope my mom can help me)

I was actually doing good for a while with my blood sugars. Well, more like I had a dangerous amount of lows that I didn't realize but also a lot of normal sugars. My mom also made these weird drinks (gooseberry juice for example) to help decrease my sugars which I think did work for a while. But ever since my doctors decreased my tresiba my sugars started to climb back up again to the high 20s (360 mg/dl I think for Americans idk sorry)

I don't know how exact the ""do I have diabetes"" rule is but I am quite sure I don't have it full blown and I may not even truly be prediabetic.

I recently have been having some major fatigue after large meals on the carb/simplesugar side and decided to get a glucose meter. My first day after a 14ish hour fast I tested at 99 and then had a large meal. 1.5 hours after I started the meal and 2 hours after I finished it my level was 177 which is not ideal. I tested again an hour and a half later and was at 152.  


Fasting again today and 14 hours in was at 96 but then 18 hours in I am back at 99.  


Those fasting levels appear to be OK but the post meal level is getting quite high in the prediabetic range.   


 I have a really long history with sodas which is a major part of the problem I am sure. In highschool I was drinking 3 liters of mountain dew a day or about 1500 calories. That was about 80% of my calorie intake every day. After highschool I got really into intermittent fasting and keto so soda was out for years but during the last few years and the pandemic especially my sugar and fastfood intake skyrocketed and fasting was no more.

Nov 2020 A1C 5.6 Glucose 100 insulin 29.8

Now, my country briefly opened fourth dose appointments for people who were first vaccinated with Sinovac and I am about to get a fourth dose (second dose of Pfizer) in a couple of weeks. Rumor is that it was an administrative decision and the health ministery didn't consult it with any medical professionals before opening appointments (doesn't sound unusual to me since I live under a highly corrupt government). They say they did this because some countries require two doses of mRNA vaccine. The appointment system was closed after a couple of hours, but I acted quickly and was able to get an appointment while the system was still open.

I had to make a reddit account to better understand something.

There have been times where at night time my father's moods just switch for the worst and out of the blue he'll become snappy and angry for no reason at all. He has come really close to straight up beating me up to the point my mom and sibling had to drag him back to which he'd then just storm up the stairs and try to sleep. The next day he'll be fine again and he will claim he does not remember any of that happening. To make matters worse he will blame it on his diabetes every single time especially his low sugar levels. He has shown me it on his libre machine I think is what it's called. I have never heard of this behaviour upon getting diabetes at all. And I'm not the most knowledgeable on it either so I figured I'd ask people that are. I'm not seeking any medical advice per say, I just want to know if anyone with type 1 diabetes here has noticed their mood changing or if low sugar levels has ever caused them to be in an entirely different state than normal?

To my knowledge it sounds more like Bi Polar Disorder and I want him to seek medical help but he refuses. And would assure me it's his low sugar. I don't want to get swayed in that explanation again after the events of tonight if it isn't the case.

I’m a 32F , 5ft5in , 132lb woman with a family history of diabetes ( father , grandparents) . I have moderate exercise levels ( jog 3 times a week on c25k )

I never thought I’d be joining this sub( naive of me) , and at the risk of sounding a sadist , I am so glad there are so many helpful people and posts! 

I am newly pregnant for the first time (5 weeks ,4 days) and as part of my first pcp visit ( where I got my blood panel tested for the first time ) , I got diagnosed with diabetes. The pcp isn’t sure if it’s type 1 or 2 but I’m gonna go on a limb and say type 2 coz of genetic history. 

The numbers are shocking and through the roof. 328 fasting and h1ac of 13.8%. I’ve not had any symptoms- no increased thirst , no urgent peeing , no blurry vision. This happened end of july.  The earliest endocrinologist appointment I got is first week of sept! 

Obviously I freaked out like mental - cried a lot - did a lot of reading and research and started doing strict lifestyle changes from 01st Aug ( No rice , no bread , no pasta , no refined sugars , and started eating apples , avocados , quinoa , lentils , beans , soup and lots and lots of salads minus the dressings ) 

I also brought a glucometer and started taking my blood glucose readings. I am on no medication yet.

Daily reading - My fasting sugar started with 300 , 265 , 261 , 256 , 234 

At this point i started taking it twice a day , once fasting and once 2 hrs after meals

Aug 14 11 am fasting -217 , 4.30 pm ( 2 hrs after lunch ) -287

Aug 15 11 am fasting-232 , 9 pm (2 hrs after dinner ) -206

Apologies for the amount of information and numbers here , but I just wanted to share everything I had . I still have time for my endocrinologist visit. 

1. Am i Type 1 ? I’m assuming not but I cant be sure as my pcp hasnt told me yet. Sorry if this is a naive question 
2. How quickly can i get this under control? I feel so scared as I’m pregnant and absolutely want my child to be safe 
3. Do you know what kind of medication I’ll be put under ? Given my level of fluctuating readings , will the dose be adjusted?

First two weeks seemed fine, but after starting the second sensor, I started getting loads of false alarms, weird readings, and events failing to record.

Abbot quickly determined that my reader (not sensor) was faulty and needed to be replaced.

But they told me they do not ship replacements or parts or any equipment ever, to any people ever.

When i said that they appeared to do so, because lots of people online describe getting supplies and replacements, then they said that they _do_ ship things, but that my serial number on my device is somehow a ""bad"" one, and so they will not ship to me. It came from their device, and is also on the box.

What they want to do for me is send me a voucher, then i have to get my medicaid doctor to write a brand new prescription (that can be problematic), then find a place that has them in stock, and pick one up in person, myself.

I am disabled, dead broke, cannot drive, and risk health events running errands, so I would rather have the replacement shipped to me, like the original device was, and like how other customers get theirs.

93,"Hi, this is my first post here and hopefully my first step to trying to get myself on track. 

A little backstory, T2 runs deep in my family. Like... core of the earth deep. I fought it off for ten years before officially being diagnosed in 2019 at 21. Because of that, and a few other factors... it's taken me so long to even accept I'm diabetic. I sometimes do really good, but then I fall off the wagon. It feels so unfair to watch everyone get to enjoy everything and anything they want and I can't have it. Plus, I love to bake. But really can't eat my own creations... I've fallen off the wagon quickly the last few month. Sporadic with my medication. Eating whatever. Not paying attention to anything with portions. 

For the first time in awhile, I felt like a normal person. But then I started feeling the high sugar effects. And found out I was in the high 300s.  I'm drinking excess water, up 3-4 times a night. Looking for a bathroom every 2 hours. I've been trying to get back on my meds, but I know my food habits aren't helping... I just feel so lost and alone. No one around me understands diabetes management outside of taking meds. 

My dad's diabetic, but he's on so many meds it keeps his a1c in the 7 range. My mom says I should ""be more like him"". I'm used to being belittled for everything I ate. My mom would say ""you're really going to eat all that?"" ""You shouldn't be eating that"" etc. I feel like anything I put in my mouth is wrong. I want to eat better and lose weight so I can be better...

They sent me home with a prescription for Metformin - 500mg, twice a day. As of yesterday morning, I've upped my dose to 1000mg each morning and 500mg each night (as instructed in the paperwork they sent home)

Yesterday I finally received my glucose monitor.. and I have some questions about my readings

My husband works the night shift so we aren't usually awake in the mornings. Still, I've been checking my blood sugar shortly after waking up. The past two days, it's been high. 139 on Friday and 134 today. I've heard of the dawn effect, but I'm not sure I can blame it on that since I don't wake up until afternoon. I'm very scared these high numbers are going to hurt my body and I don't know how to stop them!

Throughout the day, my numbers seem to range from 118-135. One hour after eating yesterday, it was 118. One hour after drinking an Atkins shake today, it was 133. I don't really understand what my numbers should be, but I get anxious each time I check my blood glucose. This is only the second day I've been checking.. After two weeks of low carb eating + Metformin, I was kind of hoping they'd be within normal ranges!

My questions: should I be worried if my blood glucose is always that high in the mornings? Is there anything I can do to lower it?  


Why was my blood glucose 118 after eating a meal yesterday, but 133 after drinking the Atkins shake? It was 160 calories, 2 net carbs, and 1g of sugar..

The  number one risk factor is your family history. Twins are used to assess  this risk for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If one twin has type 1  diabetes the second has a 50% chance of having it also. If one twin  develops type 2, the other has a 75% chance of becoming type 2 diabetic.

Genetics  also plays a role in diabetes. For type 2 the risk increases if your  family tree includes any of these genes: African American, Alaskan  native, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander, or  Hispanic/Latino.

The white European races have a higher risk of  type 1 diabetes. And people who live in colder climates are more at risk  for getting type 1. Finlanders have four times as many type 1 diabetics  as we do in the U.S. and 400 times more than Venezuela.

Some  viruses can trigger the autoimmune response that leads to type 1  diabetes. Some of these viruses can directly destroy pancreatic beta  cells. The known viruses include Epstein-Barre, mumps and  cytomegalovirus, and there are probably more.

Other possible risk  factors haven't been proven conclusively but here are a few. Low vitamin  D, not enough omega-3 fatty acids, nitrates in drinking water, and  newborn jaundice seem to increase the risks for type 1.

The sooner  you get on insulin and regulate your blood sugar levels, the fewer  complications you will suffer in your eyes, heart, kidneys and  neurological system. Right now there is no other treatment for type 1  diabetes.

29,"Hey guys,

I have a question

I've (21F) been using premixed insulin (Humalog Mix 50) for my t1d and require 3 injections daily. I've always been told to take two thirds of my total daily insulin in the morning and one third in the evening.

The doctor wrote me a dosage greater than i required and i had to take a heavy carb breakfast to match it because in my head it was either 2/3rds of the dose or i die.

However recently i started college and taking that high of a dosage and having to climb 3 floors to get to my class has me going low immediately.  I altered my dosage (even though I've been told to not play with it) and discovered i needed 7 units less than what i was prescribed, with a relatively low carb breakfast. This keeps me below 160mg/dl and my blood sugar holds at 160mg/dl even 8 hours later.

I'm worried about not getting enough basal since with premixed insulin lowering your dosage means you lower both the basal and the bolus. My bolus component works for the first 4 hours and the basal kicks in right after and works for a further 4 hours.  
So now i treat all my meals the same and take the same amount of insulin for all 3 and get good and predictable blood sugars. 

If i stay at the same blood sugars till the next meal, does that mean I'm getting enough basal? I do get enough exercise which might be helping keeping it low. I'm just scared of depriving myself off enough insulin on a molecular level because you can still get euglycemic ketoacidosis.

(I don’t have insulin), I usually ignore it brush it off whatever. Sometimes I’ll bring up my diabetes and none of them ever say anything, even my mom if I try to vent about it. They just leave me on seen, don’t respond or change the subject.. so not too long ago my sister was talking about cake randomly and how she loves it too much to give up and I jokingly(maybe) said better hope she never gets diabetes and she said I got it by eating too much noodles/pasta(I’m vegetarian). It makes me so angry that normal people aren’t even educated. People don’t give themselves diabetes by “sugar” or “eating bad”, if that were the case every fat person would have it.

59,"I've already been screened and tested by my PCP, who is not concerned at this time. 

I do not have T2D, but I've always been concerned about developing it due to being overly tired whenever I ate large amount of highly processed grains as a kid. I first got my A1c checked a year ago and found it was 5.7 with a fasting BS of 92. I was definitely concerned since I've seen the sequelae from uncontrolled diabetes. I then started intermittent fasting to try to improve my insulin resistance and cleaned up my diet a bit by prioritizing vegetable intake and reducing sugar intake. 

Just recently, I got a recheck of my blood work and found my A1c had dropped to 5.6, but my fasting BS went up to 110, and I regularly find my fasting BS to be anywhere from 99 to 110 at home. I also performed a couple pseudo-OGTTs at home, one last year and another recently, both using 75g of table sugar mixed with water. The test last year resulted in a high of 192, and a 2h reading of 84. The recent test resulted in a high of 226 at the 1h mark, and a 2h reading of 86. 

I work swing shifts and sometimes night shifts, so my sleep cycle is all sorts of messy. My fasting schedule is also wonky given my work schedule.

61,"Not sure where to begin. My husband is currently 33 and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes October 2019. His A1C was at 13.8 and what promoted him to go to the doctor was weeks of frequently urinating, feeling nauseous, dizziness, vomiting, extreme thirst, and weakness. 
(His father was diagnosed in his mid 30’s and both his maternal and paternal grandparents have/had diabetes). 

Our doctor prescribed him trulicity and gave him a glucose monitor. He was also given metformin to take daily alongside trulicity once a week. After a month of checking his sugar daily and taking his medications he started to only take trulicity 1x a week (injection).

He stopped taking metformin because he did not like how he felt and he felt taking his sugar was cumbersome. 

Flash forward to October 2020bans he’s getting ready to ship out for the Army. He stopped taking trulicity and started working out a ton. He left for basic in November and his A1C was much lower. During basic and training he was eating relatively healthy and working out consistently. Granted this was a controlled environment where you are being forced to workout and meals are pretty healthy, for the most part. 

Flash forward again to June 2021 and he’s gone for six weeks before he leaves for training again. He goes back to working out self only AND back to the way he ate prior to shipping out. 
My husband does not eat vegetables and his diet largely consists of carbs and sugar/candy. He also went back to drinking Coke, Gatorade, bang energy drinks etc. Aside from his sugared cereals and snacks/candy. 

He returns end of July after being home for six weeks (he’ll be gone through December). He had a lot more freedom now during his training and he weekly buys cookies, chips, ice cream, soda Gatorade, etc. He’s working out but not as constantly as he would during prior trainings. It’s humid as crap where he is too.

In the last four weeks since he’s been at training he has experienced three episodes of feeling sick. Or as he calls it feeling weird. Each time he is extremely dehydrated, dizzy, nauseous, has a headache and experienced swelling in his face which makes him believe he has an allergy to something.

He hasn’t “managed” his diabetes with medication since October 2020 (Trulicity). But he was working out and eating a lot better up until the last few months. 

My husband seems to think he no longer has diabetes and hasn’t had his A1C checked since he enlisted in November 2020. 

I’m really worried and concerned given that he’s already had three episodes of not feeling well within the last four weeks. What has me even more concerned is the swelling that has never happened before.

This morning I woke up and went to the ER b/c i slept from 4PM yesterday to 8AM today and still was tired. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling shaky and nauseous.

When I went to the ER they said my blood sugar levels were 116 which they weren’t too concerned about and my potassium and sodium levels were a tad bit high, but again nothing to be concerned about. But they rushed me out of there saying nothing was wrong and it’s just my anxiety. 

I do have a follow up with my PCP who will run more tests but my question is, should I be concerned about my blood sugar level ? I ate about 2 hours prior to this.

She has been on insulin for about 2 1/2 years and glimepiride for about 5 years, plus metformin for I don't know how long.  She and I have lost weight following a low carb route (seems like quite a few keto recipes).  We've been doing it for a few months now.  Besides losing weight her blood sugars seem more manageable now and she claims not to have as much crust on the bottom of her feet as she did before - so far it seems to be working for her (the jury is still out on long-term).  I will say she tried dropping glimepiride and insulin for almost 2 months (definitely wouldn't recommend this - she scared the hell out of me). Before she started on her low carb kick her a1c was 6.2, before the end of July it went to 6.6.  Not bad I suppose, but it was enough to get her back on the insulin.  We still have concerns about the glimepiride and what it might do to the pancreas and beta cells long term so at the moment she is steering clear of it (who knows, she may change her mind).

&amp;#x200B;

I on the other hand started to worry about all the animal fats she has been feeding me. I recall my little carnivore's cholesterol has been great and she might be able to handle that sort of thing better. I might be able to handle the carbs and sugar better than she can, but bad cholesterol and heart attacks run in my family - I had a heart attack about 12 years ago.  I was exercising but eating a lot of junk. Anyway, this led us to looking at the Whole Foods Plant Based Diet - too many carbs for us and we don't like their no oil stance. But we did like WFPB doctor Caldwell Esselstyn's emphasis on dark greens (we are eating more) and did pick up a nice vegan jerky recipe involving soy curls from a vegan in favor of oil. So that has been our visit to the WFPB and vegan camp so far.  If it were me worrying about diabetes I might be tempted to stay longer for a visit since I handle carbs better.  But now we are off to visit the Mediterranean diet camp and see what we like there. Maybe someday we will finally arrive at the what-works-for-us camp.  If anybody has some recipes or sources they would like to share we would be more than happy to take a look!

P.S. I thought it was interesting how both the WFPB camp and the low carb camps have their foot soldiers (both fighting a common enemy - but in different ways) and doctors who back them up.  On the WFPB side there is Eric Adams and his ""Healthy at Last"" book - a former police officer and mayoral candidate for New York City.  The doctors backing him up are Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. Dean Ornish (turned junk food junkie Bill Clinton into a vegan), and Dr. Michael Greger.  On the low carb side we have Dennis Pollock, youtube warrior taking the BG jabs for us testing out the nasty high carbs so we don't have to.  Backing him up are Dr. Richard K. Bernstein, Dr. Jason Fung, and Dr. Ahmet Ergin.  Who will win for you?  (I don't know, might depend on who you are)",diabetes,Looking for the what-works-for-us diet camp,1628875437

70,"I recently learned I’m prediabetic with an a1c of 5.7. It’s been a week and so far I’ve been working to gradually remove my regular carb favorites out of my diet. It was going well, but last night I’ll say I had a binge. I have a history of bingeing/purging and I think that’s contributed to my insulin resistance now. I’ve been working over the past 3 months to reduce binge episode frequency and control my portions and that had been working for me, but i was focused on calories and not macros and so I’m sure I ate more carbs than I should’ve.

the 5.7 crushed me. It was the first time I did an a1c screening. I’m learning to forgive myself and just work on developing a sustainable healthier lifestyle.

77,"**A quick overview of my situation:**

I was diagnosed with diabetes type 1.5 about 6 months ago. One of the critical factors that took me to the doctors in the first place is that I am a very thin person and was losing a significant amount of weight. If I had to guess I'd say I went from 147 lbs to 130 lbs. My a1c was 12.7%. I was prescribed a nightly injection of 10 units of basal insulin (Lantus.) Further testing at my current endocrinologist confirmed GAD65 and established that my cpeptides were at 1.1.  I immediately began bringing my blood sugar under control with a Keto diet. It worked very well at lowering my blood sugar and in a month and a half I was down to an a1c of 8.8%. I was feeling better overall but still not optimal while doing Keto, was experiencing very poor insulin sensitivity, and my blood sugar would often plateau after a meal before coming back down. The slightest of carbs would send me soaring. After some heavy reading and research I switched to a whole food plant based diet and have dumbfounded by how much better I feel, how controlled my blood sugar has been, and how responsive my insulin sensitivity is. I've had to reduce my basal insulin to between 5 and 6 units a day to keep from getting too low at night. I was fortunate enough to get a Dexcom prescription and it has been critical in helping me make changes over these past months.

**My current dilemma:**

Long story short at my endo appointment yesterday I found out that my a1c was down to 5.5%. Upon seeing this (and looking at my long term Dexcom charts) my endocrinologist recommended that I cease using Lantus and begin using Ozempic as a once weekly injection instead. His reasoning is that it should help increase my insulin sensitivity, prevent the lows I have been seeing with my basal insulin, and can potentially increase my beta cell generation.

Here's where I could use your advice... as you can probably tell I tend to go heavy when researching things lol. After looking into the drug more I'm confused as to why it was prescribed to me. It functions by slowing the rate at which food is released from the stomach and potentially stimulating insulin production in beta cells. People on the drug say they experienced a loss of appetite, ate less food, and lost weight. Insulin sensitivity did seem to improve however most people being prescribed the drug seem to be type 2 diabetics and higher in BMI. It seems to me that this drug increases insulin sensitivity in patients by helping them to lose weight... something I do not want and definitely do not need. I have yet to turn up any research that shows an increase in beta cell production and even if beta cell production were increased wouldn't the effect be negligible because those beta cells are still being attacked by autoimmune antibodies? I'm also worried about the potential side-effects of nausea and long term organ damage when taking this.

**TL:DR** \- Do any of you have any experience with Ozempic or similar drugs and would you recommend them?

5,"Hello Community,

I am a type one diabetic for the past 12 years from a double diabetic family, my sister and I. I grew up with a love of all things fast and loud, and when I was diagnosed I was determined not to let diabetes slow me down. This season I am driving a dirt modified in the Philadelphia area, and as much as i could say about that its not the spirit behind this post.

One thing that I remember vividly when I was diagnosed was the laundry list of things that I couldn't do anymore, and how everyone was worried about every single thing I ate and did. As a kid, it was a dark and confusing time. In the past we have worked with a JDRF but found the process frustrating, so we would like to take a more direct approach.

We want to extend an open invitation to any recently diagnosed kids who may be in that dark time. If you are local and can make the drive, we would be happy to pay your way in on a race night and get you up close with the car and the team. Come and hang out with us, watch some great racing and talk as much (or as little) as you would like about T1D. Races are usually from about 6PM-10:30PM on Saturdays, and while I will have to drive the car at points the number of classes that run mean that I have the free time to hopefully make a difference to someone. Races are loud, ear protection is recommended, but the track has full facilities and grandstand seating for the whole family.

If you or someone that you know is struggling with a recent diagnoses, or this infernal disease has you down, I would love to hear from you.

So today after a talk with my mom's doctor we found out she is diabetic Type 2, and it isn't a surprise as I had suspected it and even talked with the doctor about doing testing her. She isn't at the stage yet where she needs insulin and we are trying meds to control it. I take care of her and do most of the shopping and cooking, but here's my problem: She is super picky, almost kid-level picky, and likes her soda, sweets, and white bread with very few vegetables on that list. 

She's willing to adapt her diet now( very reluctantly) after talking to the doctor today, but they weren't very specific beyond cut-out sweets and carbs. I mean she doesn't eat healthy but she's not eating fast food or pies every meal so it's not that helpful.

Are there any foods or recipes that I can give her to help with her cravings while she ""transitions"" away from sweets that aren't bad? 

Is a low-carb diet the best one for diabetes? ( I'm so confused by the information on the web which can be conflicting)

If so what is amount of carbs should I limit her to?

Hello,

I  think I am experiencing pre-Diabetes (or Diabetes) symptoms but when I  search for information its just about what symptoms are and not what  actually happens to you, how suddenly do they come about, how long do  they last, symptom combinations, which is worse etc etc.

Blood  sugar tested twice in the last 3 weeks at 6.1. Previous a1c (3 month  sugar level test) bloods were at a level of 18 (not sure the units or  measurement) or 5,8%,  while the doctor said above 25 would be full blown  diabetes. Had another a1c done today.

I  have adapted my diet in the last 3 months (10lb down) plus 3/week  exercise but I've had huge sugar and alcohol relapses which I'm worried  'shocked' my body. I now have very dry mouth, very mild but present  thirst/feeling of de-hydration and slightly higher than normal peeing  but more so feeling the need to pee.

57,"Hello, I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes but I think I may be suffering from it. I've noticed for a while now that sometimes I just get fatigue for no reason. I push through it and eventually it gets better. I would think I was just tired and sometimes drank sugary coffee and then that would lighten me up. Also, diabetes runs on both sides of my family.

A while ago, I was out and almost fainted. I've never come that close to fainting in my life (aside from one time I was choking) and after I felt jittery and week. It progressed until the next day and I was struggling at work. I've always had a suspicion that I may have diabetes or something related but I would just push it in the back of my mind. Hours in the shift and I was debating on going home, but then I gave it one last chance and decided to get sugar into my system as a test. I drank a few gulps of lemonade and then boom, I was fine after a while.

Yesterday, I went for a walk. I had energy and I felt trapped in my home. I walked for a while, bought a slice of banana bread, and ate it on my trek. However, 20 minutes in I started feeling sluggish. I got home 20 minutes later and ate some sugary stuff and I balanced out.

Earlier today, I was filled with sudden energy again, and decided to do some cleaning. A few minutes in I started slowing down and then I ate some cookies and again, normal. Maybe this is all coincidental but does that happen to anyone else? Sudden bursts of energy followed by horrible lows if nothing is done.

One last think. I broke one of my bones a few years ago and what should've been like 2 months of healing dragged on for much longer. I researched the connection between broken bones and diabetes and had a hunch that that was why. Nonetheless, I was in a dark place so I never brought it up but in hindsight I probably should have but it is what it is.

Dunno, I want to take my future seriously now. If what I'm dealing with is what I think it is then a lot of my life will make sense. Still scared cause it's new territory and I realize I don't truly know my body. Have an appointment on the 16th for something unrelated but I'm planning on bringing it up then.

I ask this as a normal weight 23 year old who just found out he is prediabetic from a fasting glucose test, but I’ve been trying to Google people who were in my situation (weren’t obese to begin with and got prediabetes or T2) and were able to build a lot of lean muscle mass. I have built some muscle but that was before I even knew I was prediabetic and was eating moderate carb.

All the bodybuilding diets are basically moderate to high carb for bulking and low carb and/or keto for cutting. It seems that in order to build muscle you need to replenish glycogen stores, which requires carbs.

All the examples were T1 people, but I think T1s can still eat whatever foods, since they don’t produce enough insulin, rather than are resistant to it like T2.

My other theory is that building lean muscle mass can “reverse” it (hence why you don’t hear about crazy fit and muscular T2s) but if you go back to less muscle mass you probably will have pre or T2.

I’m trying to figure out if I’m doomed because lifting weights and seeing those changes made me happy, but low carb seems to be very restrictive.

72,"First a HUGE shout out to /r/diabetes.  I've learned a ton about this disease.  I've gotten inspiration, validation and information.  So thank you to each and every one of you in this sub. 

As the title says I was recently diagnosed as Type 2 Diabetic in April after receiving an a1c result of 11 with previous results labelling me as pre-diabetic.  Re-tested a little over a week ago and my a1c was down to 7 using a combination of diet, 78-80 units of glargnine insulin at bedtime, as well as 500mg of Metformin twice daily.

After the second a1c result my doctor lowered my insulin from 80 to 70 units at bedtime and upped my Metformin to 1000mg and incorporated Ozempic once weekly to try and get my a1c down.

That's all fine and good, I've lost 21 pounds, my a1c is trending right and I'm feeling better than I have in years.

Per my doctor's recommendation the only time I test my blood sugar is when I wake up.  Whether I have a snack at 11pm or don't eat after dinner around 7pm, it's the only time she's asked me to test my sugar. And yes, through the meds and diet change I've been doing great, but I want to do better and honestly, I'm not very impressed with my True Metrix test unit.  Yes it shows my blood sugar and 7/14/30 day averages but that seems to be it.

And while it does the basic job, I was thinking about getting a more modern unit like a Contour Next ONE (CNO) to start testing more frequently to keep better track and get a much better picture of what my overall numbers look like, instead of just the one morning reading.

Question: I know the CNO lets you indicate what type of test it is (fasting/pre-meal/post meal/etc,) but can you sort the results by the different type of test you've taken and only see Fasting results, post meal results, etc.?  I want to be able to give my doctor the information she requested but I also want to be able to keep better track throughout the day.

So I'm looking for advice. His doctor basically told him, that this is normal and a result of quick changing blood sugar levels and that he should keep the trigger low.

Most of the times i walk now around like on eggshells, because i don't know what and where it triggers next.

I have a three and four year old and had gestational diabetes with my younger child that was managed with exercise and diet. My grandmother who is 85 has diabetes. 

Three years later, I picked up my glucose monitor as I’ve been having some bad headaches at the end of the day. So far my after eating numbers have been in normal range, but I have had readings of 101, 104, and 109 fasting numbers in the last two weeks (after about 12-14 hours which may not be the right time to test).

I exercise hard six days per week.

I intermittent fast and have for the last 20 months.

I eat well but love to bake. I usually bake cookies or brownies once per week. I have never liked candy but have had small amounts of chocolate daily for my entire life. 

Example normal day of eating is:

Decaf tea/fast for breakfast 

Oatmeal with blueberries, chia and hemp hearts, banana pancakes with extra egg and a small amount of maple syrup or 4 scrambled eggs with mixed in cheese as first meal. 

Three cookies and tea for snack. 

Air fried Salmon on homemade salad with dressing, chilli with lots of veggies and beef, bunless burger and homemade fries, quesadilla with spinach, peppers, lettuce, beef and rice, butternut squash soup and grilled cheese on sourdough, or shepherds pie for dinner.

Once a week we air pop a ton of popcorn. I melt butter and put on quite a bit of salt and we all watch a movie. 

Once a month we have a fish fry and deep fry the fish my family has caught. 

Once a week I’ll order a hot chocolate while on a walk to the park with my kids. Or have a glass of orange juice. Usually I’m drinking water. 

These are just little examples of what I’m eating. I haven’t been to a doctor since moving and will have to find a new one. Since I’m already exercising, besides completely cutting out sugar and limiting carbs is there anything you would recommend I do? Specific tests to ask for?

Since have been diagnosed has pre diabetic, have been very obsessed with this A1C and blood sugar things but I want to know more about it. 

If you have some articles or you have direct answers to my below questions, this will make me learn something.

My A1C is 6% which is about an average of 126mg/dl if I am not wrong.

1. How is this calculated? 

2. Does the average got affected by how many times my blood sugar spike during the last 3 months?

3. If my last meal is at 8:00 PM, will my morning blood sugar be around 126mg?

4. If a healthy person with perfect blood sugar stop working out for the next 3 months and eat 3 to 4 unhealthy meals a day. Is the A1C can be over 5.7%?

5. I got the advice to lose weight to get this back to normal, but as far as I know, I can lose weight even by eating carbs (of course frequency and quantify will change with the respect of calorie in vs out) Is this gonna work from A1C perspective?

6. I am on intermittent fasting 16/8, should I workout before my first meal or after?

7. If after, should I wait 30min since blood sugar start to go up by that time?

8. My daily intake of carbohydrates were about 250 grams (about 350 Jasmine rice per meal) and this doesn’t add pops and sugary desserts which I am sure that I am close to the 350-400 daily carbs intake. I’ve been cutting my carb intake to 100 grams a day max and cutting all fast food, pops, and very sweet treats. Is this going to make a difference or do I need to entirely stop taking carbs?

A couple months back I had my first fasting blood sugar test done for I’m not sure how many years and it was 100mg/dl (normal range 70-99mg/dl) according to the lab 

I understand this would only barely be considered prediabetic or high normal, but I barely eat any sugar at all and have no obvious risk factors for diabetes so I thought it was odd that it would even be slightly high, I was expecting it to be low 

Anyway, recently I was diagnosed with celiac disease and my Autoimmune also tested positive twice 1:160X and I noticed I would often crash heavily after meals, sometimes to the point where even talking or walking feels like a big task 

Today I purchased a contour plus one glucose monitoring device just to see if my blood sugar levels could have anything to do with my symptoms / health 

I tested 3 times today after I got it, once when I got home which was about 4 hours after eating a meal, once one hour after finishing a meal and once two hours after finishing a meal (when I was feeling lowest on energy)

My assumption was blood sugar levels should be the highest after meals and fasting should have the lowest levels 

Here are my results:
1. 92 mg/dl (4 hours after eating)
2. 112 mg/dl (1 hour after eating)
3. 69 mg/dl (2 hours after eating)

Fasting done at the doctors in the morning - 100mg/dl

Why would my blood sugar be the lowest 2 hours after eating and highest when fasting? Isn’t this the opposite of how it should be? I understand diabetes is when blood sugar is too high, but what can cause a decrease in blood sugar after eating and energy crashes?

60,"Hey guys, this has been bothering me for awhile and I could really use some advice or input if anyone else has experienced this.

*tl;dr : my friends do not act or seem to care about my diabetes and do not help me out*

My closest friends have not always been the most caring people towards me, but their other qualities made up for it a lot in the past and I love them a lot (they are nice and friendly, just don't ask a lot about how I'm doing). However, I feel like I'm now seeing how unsupportive they are ever since my diagnosis (type 1 as of November 2020). I did not have the best experience, went into dka and stayed at the hospital for four days, my friends were quite upset over the fact that I could have died. And that reason is why I used to think that none of them ever asked much about diabetes. I always assumed that perhaps it was traumatizing for them and they did not like to be reminded of that night.

Anyway, after my diagnosis I told them a lot about what this meant, how I have to take insulin, about blood sugar and highs and lows, etc. Just a lot of basic stuff for them to be aware of. I noticed in January that they did not ask how I was doing at all and this bothered me, you think they'd want to check up on me more. I confronted them about it and asked if they did not care at all or something and they all said that they just thought I got too many questions from my parents and did not want to bother me. Okay, kind of a lame excuse but whatever, they started asking me more after that. It only lasted a couple of weeks (barely) and they stopped.

Now I'm not someone who likes to bother people with my issues, but I feel that being a diabetic can be quite a serious issue in some moments. For instance, when I got my new CGM that has an alarm, I told them exactly what it sounded like and it means I'm going low and need something to eat/drink. In June, we went to my friend's cottage all together for the first time. Safe to say it was the worst my blood sugars had ever been. My numbers were low the entire time and my CGM kept beeping every hour it seemed, and perhaps only once did they ask if I was okay. Everytime it went off they ignored it, and I would go and grab something even though I was feeling really ill and they wouldn't even look at me. I feel I can partially blame myself for not making it more clear that I need assistance sometimes (again I really hate to bother people) but a quick ""are you okay?"" or ""can I get you something?"" would be highly appreciated. 

I really want to lay it out on them on how we cannot act like everything is like it used to be and we can be spontaneous but I have learned that I do need to plan my day to ensure I won't be too low or too high and I am getting my proper meals. But I hate to be a bother which I know it's not since they are my friends but it's this mental barrier I can't seem to get over. Am I overreacting about all of this? I am just so scared I am a burden and I really should talk to them about it but everytime I speak about something diabetes related they seem so uninterested. I just feel so isolated from them now. I am so sorry how long this is but does/did anyone else have friends that don't seem supportive?

Having worked 20 years now in the technology industry myself (designing/developing systems, algorithms, data, etc), this raised some flags in my head so I did some investigation. Having read ALL of the Medtronic data sheets and guides, I could find no information whatsoever that indicates what my educator told me is correct. Nowhere does it specify that, after replacing a transmitter, Auto Mode should only be turned on after any period of time. 

Further to this, I called Medtronic support myself. They also said that there was no need to turn off Auto Mode at all after replacing a Transmitter, because all of the data required for Auto Mode (*""the algorithm"", which, IMO, is just some weighted average calculations over a moving window of data points*) is in the pump. I agree with that support person, so I'm at odds as to why a diabetes educator (who is highly experienced) would tell me this. Perhaps he was drunk when he spoke with me late at night?

I feel its been a bit of both to be honest. I've been heavily depressed since my teens. Always assumed everyone else thought the same way as me but as I grew I acknowledged that this wasn't the case. I rarely ever open up about my depression and its affect on my control and life, or how my diabetes makes depression worse. 

I've done things in recent years which involved abusing my insulin and other drugs in order to cause self harm, but for some reason I'm still around so I'm grateful for that. This came from how deeply depressed I've become.

17,"On the first of July I was officially diagnosed with diabetes (A1C 11.4%). I was put on 2000mg of metaformin and 10units of Toujeo at night.
I’m currently typeless as my family medicine wants to bring my A1C down first.
I am using Libre and have trouble with dips at 3am.
I don’t sleep on my sensor as I place it on my chest and sleep on either my sides or my back. It does bounce back but my problem is that 3am is when I take my dogs out for their walks. It makes it very challenging for me to wake up. I live in Saudi and even though the temps might not be extremely high in the shades, the sun is unforgiving!

I do have trouble eating since I don’t enjoy healthy sources of carbs or multiple meals, simple sugars were pretty much my only source of carbs. I am working on those problems.
 I need advice, firstly on how to stay on top of things and secondly how to make sure I don’t get lows around 3am so waking up becomes less of a challenge.

I did have my doubts of them being compression lows but I don’t understand the symptoms I feel, the graph does make sense (the drop isn’t sudden), and I still tend to skip (several) meals and snacks which makes me believe they are true lows.
Last night I ate a piece of chocolate before bed, I have been watching this brand’s effect on me and it doesn’t get me out of range. I slept around 12:30am with my last scan saying I was at 96mg/dL (an hour later). I woke up today hopeful, to find a the dreaded red dip there again this night.

I need advise. I was diagnosed 2 months ago. I think I am in honymoon period since my sugar goes down many times without bolus insulin. Actually since the heat increase, the walking and surfing (holidays) I was getting constant lows. Today I stoped with the basal insulin to avoid a low while surfing and my sensor came out. Even if I didn't have any insuline today I had to had some glucose tablet several times because my blood sugar kept going 65-60. In general is quite asymptomatic, sometimes i feel slow and get some sakes but not do noticeable..

Now without sensor I am worried to get some bad lows...I am planing on stoping all my basal/bolus insulin as long as my sugar doesnt go over 180 until i get back home (in 4 days). I got lots of sugar, geld and glucose tablets with me.

How can I keep getting lows without insuline? Might it be that i still had some residual basal from 48h ago (brand is abasaglar, should last 24h 18U). Or is it normal sometimes to be on 60-65 and I shouldn't worry.

Is it safe enough to rely on bloodstrips in my situation with all the lows?

I was planing to drink some wine with friends later, should I dont drink at all to avoid lows?

I am a bit stressed sorry if I am not so clear...

Btw my libre 2 target ratio is 96% on range (70-180) 2% low 2% high. I normally inject 18 basal insulin units and bolus insulin only when I am raising quick and about to go over 180 (normally once a day or so depends on what I eat).

42,"TLDR: nobody knows what type I am, I'm debating expensive genetic testing or just going ""typeless."" 

As background, I'm 39 and my brother has T1 diabetes since childhood. I had GD with my first pregnancy, but not my second. 

Aug 2020 - was diagnosed as T2 by my PCP after going to Urgent Care with vision changes. A1C was 11. Put on Metformin, which did nothing on its own, finally lowered BG with Glyburide and Metformin, and low carb (not keto) diet/weight loss (\~30 lbs, still somewhat overweight but not obese by BMI).

March 2021 - A1C down to 6, BG getting into the low range between meals so PCP stopped the Glyburide. BG levels jumped into the high 200s and would not go down, even after restarting the Glyburide, so I was started on Tresiba at night and ordered antibody testing. Came back positive for antibodies GAD65/GAD65H, ICA512/IA-2H and ZnT8. PCP diagnosed me with LADA/T1.5 and referred me to an endo. 

Aug 2021 - A1C is now 7. Go to endo and she says she isn't sure what type I have, despite antibody test, and recommends genetic testing for MODY which would cost about $2,500 out of pocket and that's a stretch for me at the moment. She said I have characteristics of both T1 and T2 and she's ""stumped."" She said C-peptide testing would not be helpful since it's clear I DO produce insulin as I've had very little insulin for a year and never been in DKA. She criticized everything PCP did, adjusted meds, added Glipizide instead of Glyburide, and got me a CGM which I love. I'm supposed to go back every 3 months with new labwork to monitor closely in case my pancreas decides to suddenly stop. 

Questions: How much would knowing MODY status help or change anything if doctors don't know what type I could be? Do any other people just go through life and not know what type they are and it's NBD? Should I just presume at this point that I'm T2 since I'm not fully insulin dependent and it's been a year since my diabetes diagnosis?

By summer he was in the ER due to a ton of problems. Diabetic ketoacidosis, dangerously bad dehydration, sepsis, just kind of the works. He left after over a month in a hospital with stage 3 kidney failure, a dialysis schedule, and insulin. He was pretty much at death's door when he was put in the hospital, so we all took the aftercare very seriously.

For a while, stuff really felt like it was improving. He cleaned his diet up a lot, was slowly becoming more active (turns out a month in a hospital bed really atrophies you), was watching his numbers, etc. 

Eventually his doctors decided things were good enough to take him off of dialysis. Then they decided that he was good enough to take him off insulin. Then he decided that that gave him free reign of everything and he immediately fell into old habits.

For the past month or so he's just been living on almost entirely carbs. Way too much sodium, too. He is constantly eating popsicles that have a notable amount of sugar in them. He has gotten less and less responsible about even checking his blood sugar. Today was the first time he checked it in a week. It was over 300 mg/dl.

He constantly falls asleep, sometimes even in the middle of conversations. His feet look like two balloons and that swelling is starting to reach his legs in their entirety. His cognition is getting worse, he constantly acts like he is about to pass out.

I think that he probably is getting to a point where he will need dialysis and insulin again, but he has not made any doctor appointments. I want him to go to the ER because stuff is becoming worse every day, but he just says that it'll be fine. It's very clear that things are not fine, and I have no idea how I can break through to him. At the rate he is going, I'm honestly not sure if he'll be around at the end of the month. He was not nearly this bad two weeks ago, even.

Does anyone have advice for just getting through to someone? I don't want actual medical advice, but I guess it's also worth asking if you would consider this to be ER worthy? I don't have diabetes and don't really know anyone who does other than him, so I'm not sure how severe a situation has to be to count as very severe.

Much more background... I'm type 1, diagnosed in 2007. I used a Minimed pump from 2008 to 2014. In 2014 I made a big move and decided to switch to using pens. I made the switch because I was tired of having a pump constantly clipped to myself and enjoyed not having to do site changes every three days.

Fast-forward to now... I've been using a Dexcom for five years and love it. I'll never get rid of it. The Dexcom integration of the Tandem T:Slim pump has me very strongly considering going back to pumping. I have great insurance so cost is not a huge concern but it's still an investment... and I'm worried that I'll be annoyed to be tethered and making site changes every three days again.

My numbers are... ok. My A1C has been in the 7s for a while and, while that's not too bad, I'd like to do better for my own future. I know Control IQ would be a huge help not only for better numbers but also for fewer lows and highs (which negatively impact my mental and physical health).

His A1c was around 7 and his blood glucose was consistently very high (in the 300s) when he was released from the hospital, so he was put on slow-acting insulin once a day at bedtime, something like 20 units (?). He was told to monitor blood sugar daily first thing in the morning before breakfast. It is still high, at around 150. A few days ago he finally had an appointment with a diabetes doctor who ordered a 2-week monitoring with a transdermal device. It turns out that after good intake my husband's blood sugar is 300-400!

What's in store for him? We're guessing he'll be put on a different insulin regimen and overall needs a higher daily dosage?

He lost 70 lbs as a result of pancreatitis, and his BMI is now on the high end of normal.

I just got back from my six month check-up, and I’ve lowered my A1C to 6.6. I’ve been lifting weights three times a week for 45 minutes, and I’ve subtly modified my diet, although I’m not strict. I still have ice cream most nights, and I’ll eat bread in limited amounts, for example. My approach has been to just remain aware of how carby my intake has been and to limit myself accordingly. 

My doctor presented medication as an option, but told me it was up to me whether or not I want to start it, since my numbers are already at goal levels. When I said I’d like to wait, he implied he agreed with my decision. He’s suggested I’m already doing everything I should be and that I shouldn’t obsess over my numbers.

Of course, many promising small studies end-up as failures, but I decided to give it a try.  Its use is definitely ""off-label"" for non-T2 and it's too early to tell if it is helping me yet.

Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs.

&gt;***There are a few different types of diabetes:***

* Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas, where insulin is made. It’s unclear what causes this attack. About 10 percent of people with diabetes have this type.
* Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin, and sugar builds up in your blood.
* Prediabetes occurs when your blood sugar is higher than normal, but it’s not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
* Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar during pregnancy. Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the placenta cause this type of diabetes.

A rare condition called diabetes insipidus is not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a similar name. It’s a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body.

I just had a very disappointing experience with Abbott customer service and I want to know if I am in the right or if I am just high maintenance. 

Last Wednesday, I changed my Freestyle Libre 2. I don't expect miracles for the first 24h, so the fact that it was 3 mmol/l (54 mg/dl) inaccurate didn't throw me off. At the 48h mark, it was still 3-4 mmol/l (54-72 mg/dl) inaccurate and I called customer service for a replacement. The values were 3-4 mmol/l (54-72 mg/dl) too low, so it woke me up throughout the night and I think for the price I pay for a medical device, it is too far off.  
Well, I called them and they said that a ""specialist"" has to go through the numbers with me, I should expect a call back in 48h. I wouldn't have had a problem with that, however, they wanted me to keep the inaccurate faulty sensor on until they called me. After a few more hours I got upset and changed it because the sensor got more and more inaccurate.   
They called me back today and the guy was so condescending and mansplainy to me.   
He said that 4 mmol/l aren't a big deal and that ""many customers"" tell him that it is not a big deal. He constantly told me that, yes, they will exchange the sensor bc it is too far off but then in the next sentence told me that 4 mmol/l is no big deal bc ""you didn't have to call a doctor or fainted, correct?"".  I asked him if he was a diabetic and how he was talking to me was not ok. I hate being confrontational and always am respectful to customer service ppl but I am furious. He also constantly explained to me over and over again that if the arrow goes anywhere but straight, you can't trust the values or if you've just eaten it is not accurate.. as if I were an idiot...

Last year I started having symptoms of diabetes (blurry vision, tingling hands/feet, frequent urination and being very very thirsty).

31,"I'm sure we all have plenty of stories of when our blood sugar was low. In the moment, low blood sugar is not funny but when looking back some of them you can laugh at. I'll share a few of my stories and I'd love to hear yours! For reference I'm 25M, had T1 for 9 years and always been MDI.

When I was in high school I was taking a college math test and my blood sugar went low. Silent room full of students, I was sitting in the front row, and of course I have to eat something. I felt so awkward pulling out my granola bar and opening the loud wrapping. Of course it was a crunchy granola bar so while I'm crunching away I feel like the whole class can hear me eating. I probably could have left the room but I wasn't one to make a big deal over things, so I just ate it and continued the test.

Around that time I actually crashed a car when my blood sugar went low. I didn't have much experience driving or with diabetes at the time. It was a very snowy night, icy roads, and I was hanging out with friends at their place. We planned to go eat at a restaurant and before we left I checked my blood sugar, it was high. I wasn't familiar with the concept of prebolusing and insulin action times back then, but I thought I would just take some insulin to correct the high and also some more since we were about to be eating. I drove to the restaurant and while waiting at a red light at the top of a hill on a main street, I felt my blood sugar go low. I panicked and thought I need to get to the restaurant quickly so I can eat. I took off too fast from the light and started sliding sideways and fishtailing down the hill, and ended up going over a curb and through a set of bushes into an empty parking lot. We had to call a tow truck and walk into a random restaurant nearby where I got some food. Talk about poor decision making.

One of my worst experiences was a time I went hiking with some friends. It was a long all day hike, and towards the end we got lost and were trying to find our way back to the car. I thought I had brought a lot of food but I ended up eating it all throughout the day, and then my blood sugar went low. Everyone else was out of food. After testing and seeing I was in the 40's, I looked through my backpack again and found a smushed PB&amp;J sandwich that saved me, and we eventually found our way back to the car. Talk about scary. I lived and I learned from that one.

Needless to say, these days I always carry sugar on my person and plenty of snacks and sugar everywhere I go. I like to carry packs of fruit snacks and smarties, plus chewy granola bars and juice boxes. The system I've been following lately is: 

-quick walk: CGM/phone, snack in my pocket

-anywhere in the city: CGM/phone, snack in my pocket, bag with extra snacks and glucose meter kit with insulin pen

-anywhere outside the city like camping, road trip, etc: double of everything above (two bags with glucose meter kits and snacks each. extra CGM sensor and insulin if it's more than a few days)

40,"So I just started metformin. I've been a year without seeing my doctor due to Covid, but I knew I was at *least* prediabetic as my roommate is diabetic, my gf is hypoglycemic, so we have the glucose meters in the house.. And it runs in my family so I know the symptoms. My finger tips felt *dizzy* when I woke up, falling asleep almost immediately after meals, etc. Took my bloodsugar last year it was 320. So for a year, I ate nothing but an ultra-lowcarb diet and walked every day. My bloodsugar was around 120 fasting. On occasion I'd have something I wasn't supposed to, and it would climb up and SLOWLY come down.

Anyways, finally got to see my doctor, had lab-work done, got the diagnosis I knew I would get. Doc said I caught it early enough and treated it well enough it could be reversed at least for a long time (pancreas is at 70% functioning so if it goes into remission, damage still done it's likely to come back later as I age).

Doc also said with metformin it's still ok to have the occasional drink. Especially where I drink gin, which is low carb for alcohol. (Mixers can change that of course). I never have more than 1 drink a night, and it's not every night either. Few times a week.

I usually have my gin WITH my dinner. Not a few hours later. Without metformin, after one glass of gin the next morning my bloodsugar would be the same or 2-3 points lower, no major difference. Had my first glass of gin while taking metformin, and it was like I didn't take the metformin. (It didn't skyrocket, it just didn't go down at all after the 3 hour post meal peak level).

I took the metformin with dinner and that's also when I had my one drink. So I'm guessing that it messed with the efficacy of the medication.

But if you can drink while on metformin.. what's the safe timing? An hour after taking it? 3 hours? An hour BEFORE taking the second dose at night?

Every time I try to Google the info I just get ""drinking excessive can be dangerous as it lowers blood sugar"" and ""its ok to have the occasional drink while on metformin"" but nothing on the correlation between time of dosage and time of beverage consumption.

51,"Hello everyone! I’m hoping to get some advice/see if anyone has experienced anything similar to this. For the past maybe 2 months, I have been dealing with frequent urination. As a nurse, this eventually became a red flag to me for diabetic symptoms. At first I thought maybe it just seemed like I was peeing a lot, so I started recording how often I was going and went 3 times in one hour as soon as I began recording.

Rather than stop at an urgent care, I decided to take the cheaper route and purchase a $20 freestyle libra Gluck meter at CVS. I walked to the store, came home and took my blood sugar, and had a post-prandial glucose of 148 (this was ~2-3 hours after dinner). I checked again an hour later, and it was 131. Finally, I checked a fasting glucose in the morning which was totally normal at 89.

I don’t have any risk factors for diabetes. I’m 5’2”, about 90 lbs, have been a stable/unchanging weight my entire life, no medical history or medications, don’t drink soda or sweetened beverages, and go to Pilates almost every morning. I do like to eat a fair amount of pasta and the occasional dessert. I’m slightly worried about the elevated glucose after eating but perhaps am overreacting.

I was paying out of pocket costs for the test strips and it was getting really pricey. I called my insurance company and found out they will cover a free meter and reduced costs supplies. I picked the OneTouch Verio Flex.  I started using it and my numbers seem way off. I know that all meters can read differently but this seems too high. The one touch told me my fasting blood sugar was 148. It hasn’t been that high since I was diagnosed. It will tell me I’m high (well over 150) but my body doesn’t feel that. 
I’m starting to test with both meters at the same time and the Rightest is at least 20 points less than the OneTouch. These might be within the “20%” accuracy range but to me there is a big difference in those 20 points. I don’t feel like I’m getting an accurate representation of my blood sugar levels and how food is affecting it. 

Honestly, I’m finding it really demoralizing to wake up and 148 fasting. Or when I have a meal that I know from previous experience will not make me go high shows high on the meter.

I was recently diagnosed by my primary doctor with type 2 diabetes. For now, he has put me on Metformin and scheduled me to come see him again in 3 months, and also suggested I schedule with an endocrinologist after said appointment. He suggested I try and make some changes to my diet and exercise more before I see him next.

I discussed with my doctor that I have had an extremely difficult time controlling my eating and need some extra help with getting it under control. I won't get too in-depth with it, because some of it is still technically un-diagnosed, but I more or less have trouble with maintaining portion sizes and I go on what feel like uncontrollable binges. A therapist I previously saw believed I had an eating disorder. I mentioned this to my primary doctor and he mentioned this would be something to bring up to the endocrinologist when I see them to see what they can do to help with that.

I'm not expecting to be able to completely correct my eating habits in these next 3 months, but I want to at least take some steps to slowly correct what I can correct. Problem is, I have no idea what I am doing in terms of what I should be replacing my unhealthy options with and what I should be looking to avoid on the food labels. The doctor mentioned recommending a dietician, but it looks like that won't be happening until after I see him next in 3 months.

I was hoping I could get some basic non-professional advice on small things to look out for/change. I have a few questions I was hoping this community could help me with:

&amp;#x200B;

1. On food labels, what should I be avoiding specifically as a diabetic? My primary doctor mentioned avoiding fats, but is that all fats? Is there anything else I need to make sure I avoid, such as carbs or cholesterol?
2. Should I be avoiding snacking completely? If not, what snacks are diabetic-friendly? Currently I only eat 2 meals a day (lunch and dinner), but unfortunately snack way too often.
3. My doctor mentioned some diabetic medicine not being covered by most insurance companies, is this something to be worried about?

So about two months ago I was at my cousins wedding and I admittedly drank more than I am proud of. At the end of the night, I vaguely remember eating some desert and taking a “25g bolus” for it. I got a ride home and passed out immediately. 

As my fiancé was going to bed she heard my pump alarming and saw the dexcom graph going straight down. She also noticed that I had 27 units on board! I hadn’t taken insulin for 25 carbs, I had accidentally entered 25 units directly into the pump!

The night was not pretty and ended with the glucagon. I later changed my max bolus from 25u to 15u and vowed to never drink like that again. Problem solved, right? Wrong!

Just this past week I started feeling low, this time I was sober. I checked my IOB and it was 16 units! I had done it again. How does this keep happening?

6,"Hi everyone!

I am not diabetic, but have been diagnosed as pre-diabetic a few years ago (A1C currently ok at 5.3). I have had a bunch of unexplained symptoms lately so even though my A1C is good, I decided to check my BG periodically. Turns out I am all over the place with my numbers (granted, not diabetic high). I went from 140 to 60 in 15 minutes once just from walking upstairs...

I finally convinced my doctor to let me have a CGM since finger sticks were showing in 50s/60s with no symptoms along with catching a few symptomatic rapid drops of 60-80 mg/dL in 15-20 minutes. 

With all that said, I had the Libre 2 (US one) and just switched to the Dexcom G6 so that I can use my phone and share alerts since that wasn't possible with the Libre 2. In the 3 weeks I have had the CGM, I have caught highs up to 180-200 and lows down to low 50s multiple times. I would say about 80% of the readings were accurate and verified with a meter, even when asymptomatic. I continue to catch rapid drops as well. 

Ultimately this leads me to wondering what is normal? Should BG drop 60-80 points that fast? I am learning what symptoms can be warning me I am dropping fast that I previously ignored as a different problem. 

Also, no matter what my BG is before exercise, I always drop to the mid 50s-mid 60s within 15 minutes without fail. I've started with a level of 140, 120, 100... doesn't matter. I actually almost passed out Thursday thanks to this as I (very stupidly) pushed through the last 5 minutes of my 17 minutes on the elliptical even though I was shaky and the CGM was warning me.

I will check with doctor, how soon I can experiment by not taking Jardiance.

1. A piece of medical equipment attached to you 24/7/365 would be intrusive as hell. I could never have something attached to me while I’m sleeping, showering, or doing any activity. Surely it would get in the way, plus you have to be extra mindful not to damage it

2. Said piece of medical equipment is literally vital to your survival. What if i bump against something and it breaks? What if the pump fails? What if I’m away from home when it happens? What if it happens while I’m travelling outside my country?

3. Having my synthetic pancreas attached to me would attract unwanted attention. Those ignorant to the condition would stare. Maybe it’s a personal thing, but i quite frankly don’t want random strangers to know about my condition 

4. Having my pump attached to me 24/7/365 would constantly remind me of my condition. I don’t know about you  guys, but i’d rather live life feeling like a normal person and not have to be constantly reminded of my condition

30,"Hi guys, I'm a 27 year old caucasian female, I weigh 55kg, I haven't been diagnosed with anything as of yet. I've been struggling now for about 9 months with some troubling symptoms. It started very randomly but I'd notice on occasion I would suddenly get a banging headache, sweats, blurry vision, fast heart rate, breathlessness, dizziness, wild moos swings etc. I didn't know what was happening but just ignored it for a while, it started becoming more frequent and severe, so I decided to go to the doctor. Not sure if related but I also developed migratory joint pain and occasionally shooting pains down my legs.

Anyway the doctor ran many tests for arthritis and anemia, ibd as I have some stomach issues etc. All negative however she did notice I had slightly elevated blood sugar of 8.1 and asked me to come in for an A1C.

After she said my sugars were slightly high I bought a blood checker to keep an eye on things. It's come clear that the symtoms I am experiencing are due to a drasting drop in blood sugar down into a low.

It took me a while to connect that it was in fact reactive hypoglycemia. My A1c was fine and my fasting blood sugars are usually around 5-5.5 however sometimes they ate 5.8 and on a few occasions I have recorded 6-6.4. But generally my blood sugars are normal. I've just noticed a trend when I eat or drink anything carby. The first time I checked it spiked to 11 in about half an hour then dropped to 3 within 15-20 mins. This caused some severe symtoms but I don't know how low it actually got as it was already going up slightly when I checked.

It appears to me that my first phase insulin response is lagging and not lowering sugars much then sugars raise again then drop suddenly at second phase. For example:

After a meal or sugar

sugars went from 5 to 10.7 within 30 mins, it then dropped to 10.5 and stayed at that for 10 mins, then spiked to 11, and then drastically dropped down to 3.

This is happening more and more frequently now and the trend is always the same, drastic spike for 30 mins, small drop for 10, spike again and then drastic drop.

I'm also constantly so tired and I just don't feel right at all. I do the bathroom alot but moreso if I drink sugary drinks.

My doctor was initially worried about type 1 diabetes but when my a1c was fine he just dismissed me and my symptoms like they are OK, I do not agree. He said he wasn't worried about type 2 as I don't fit the criteria.

I'm just concerned as it seems like my first phase insulin response is lagging or decreasing causing the second to overshoot. I'm finding it very hard to control and even a tiny bit of sugar causes drastic swings, so I have been trying to stick to a low GI diet. But now this happens almost daily

My doctor didn't seen concerned and I asked him if he could run an autoantibody test in case it is a slow type 1, he said he didn't know what test to run and told me to sugar if it happens and dismissed me.

Both of my parents have autoimmune disorders. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar prior to diagnosis? Possibly early LADA? Does this have any possible relation to diabetes?

Sorry would just like some guidance as I'm feeling dismissed by doctors, they never even bothered ordering a ogtt to diagnose the RH, even though some of the episodes nearly sent me to hospital

We thought since a small part of the sensor broke off in the water that it was sensing the water instead of my blood and was messing up the readings since water doesnt contain glucose. So we replaced it and it seemed to work fine the rest of the day. Flash forward to today, we go swimming for a few hours with breaks in between. After I get home im quite hungry so i reconnect my phone to see my number so i can eat, and it completely fails. A whole 10 days worth of readings just gone. Complete sensor failure and i had to rip the poor thing off my body. What the hell is happening?? I cant keep wasting the sensors I only brought one box of 3.

74,"Hello,   


I have new-onset Type II diabetes, after having been borderline diabetic for a long time. I am F and in my 40's, normal weight (used to be thin). I am not on medication for it as I have been managing it with diet (no sugar, no refined carbs) for a while, and I was not able to see a doctor for ages due to first COVID and then I was traveling for a while.   


I am not asking for a medical diagnosis, but I have a broader question inspired by a medical test result I received today, which my doctor will follow up with.   


So, backstory quickly: I started a keto diet about 10 or so days ago for weight loss. I have been on these before. I knew I was in ketosis because my ketostix have been dark purple.   


Today, I had some blood tests and a pee test for a totally unrelated reason, and my urinary ketones were 80 mg/dl, which is ""very high."" Well, okay, that's fine. That's what I thought. I have been eating very low carbs, after all.   


But this got me to wondering -- if someone IS diabetic **and** doing the keto diet, but they were in ketoacidosis rather than ketosis, how would they tell? Would it be by testing their blood insulin as well?   


Sorry if the question is naive. I have not ever tracked my blood insulin with a home monitor and was diagnosed with new diabetes (which I was told was probably from gaining a bit of weight last year, about 20-30 lbs. after always being thin) in the middle of the COVID closures, when doctors were not seeing patients physically, from a blood test in ER for another medical issue: my blood sugar was not incredibly high, around 140 if I remember, but it had never previously been over 120, although it crept up over the years. Even now, the doctors here are only just starting back up again. I won't be seeing my doctor for a month due to backlog.   


So I figured someone must know about diabetics on keto and how to then distinguish ketosis from ketoacidosis in that case. I assume the later has obvious symptoms, but I am not quite sure, and ketosis also has some. I do not think I am in ketoacidosis myself, I would go straight to the ER if so, but it definitely did get me wondering if you could tell the difference from home, particularly because I also travel abroad here and there, and there is not always medical care readily available where I do often go, or I might go far afield somewhere. So knowing how to tell the difference would be really useful! And probably important.

For the A1c:  Approximately 60% of it is the last month.  Likely the last two weeks is &gt;30% of it.  So one could just be really strict in the last month and especially in the last couple weeks and probably keep their a1c pretty low.

They had me on this ridiculous sliding scale of 200-250 (2 units) 250-300 (4 units) and up from there.. seemed like it was only geared towards type 2. After weeks of sugars in the 4 to 500 range the doctor was able to get 35 measly units of Lantus approved which did very little considering a diabetic tray in jail consisted of the same thing everyone else got minus a cake (applesauce instead).

9,"CONTENT WARNING: EATING DISORDERS

I'm reluctant to see a diabetes nurse educator because I am anorexic and I really don't want to talk about my eating with a healthcare practitioner who doesn't specialize in the treatment of eating disorders. In my experience doing this in the past has just made my anorexia much worse and I can't risk that. My endocrinologist doesn't understand that and is pressuring me into making an appointment because she's convinced that I need to learn to ""better control"" my carbohydrate intake despite the fact that my A1c is already excellent.

I already manage my own medications. I adjust my own I:C ratio and my own correction factor and I have been doing so for the last year. I grew up with a diabetic health care professional. I feel like I have a really solid grasp over handling my medications and I know, intimately, what to look out for when it comes to complications.

Got on a treatment plan with cholesterol meds, blood pressure meds, and the dr put me on Janumet XR. Told me to lose weight, exercise, and referred me to a dietician. 

Finally took things serious and started busting my butt to change my path. Went on a reduced calorie diet and tried to keep my total carb intake per day under 130. I also started walking about 1 mile every day.

Fast forward to 2 months in and I had worked my caloric intake each day from 3000 down to about 2100-2200 daily and finally got in to see a dietician (thank you insurance preapprovals for taking so long). I had lost about 40 lbs at the 2 month mark and she basically said, it's working, don't change a thing that you are doing.

Yesterday was the 3 month mark and I returned to the doctors office to have blood work done. As of yesterday I have lost 53 lbs and weigh 361. I'm up to about 1.5 miles of walking per day and feeling great. I got on my doctors web portal last night to check my blood work and my cholesterol is in the normal range and my A1C was down to 6!

I got this\* bag off Amazon that claimed it would keep the insulin insulated, but when I tested it with a thermometer, the bag turned out to basically not be insulated at all.  The thermometer got below 2C for ~20 minutes from being next to the ice pack (which is how the manufacturer says to use it) and then pretty rapidly warmed up to 18°C

I saw some recommendations on this forum for ""Frio"" bags, but their website says that they keep the insulin at 18-26°C (as opposed to 2-8°C where the insulin needs to be..)

I only have a few days until I have to leave, so right now I'm leaning toward a supremely wonky solution of putting a bunch of ice packs in a regular drink cooler bag, then putting the insulin vials inside of vacuum coffee mugs.

59,"My post will be U.S. centric mostly because that is where I am from. I do know other countries Libre 2 devices can have abilities that ours do not have. Like a functional phone app for instance. One day we too might be able to use an app on our phones as well as the reader. But since the FDA has not approved it at this time we do not have one. The Libre 14 day does have a functional phone app here in the U.S. so it that is important you might want to consider that model.

 As for the other CGM’s I am not familiar with them and went with the one the Endo wanted me to use. Since it is working I am happy with it and the extra information it is giving me.  If it was not I would be checking into other CGMs. 

I am not an expert on using one but have found from paying attention to others as well as my own experiences the following.

Starting with the reader, be careful if you store it in your pocket or purse unprotected. Not only is the screen fairly scratch prone so keys and it do not mix there is also a test strip port in it. Mine had a tiny piece of pocket lint get into it which made it stop working. I was lucky and blew it out with compressed air. Since then I added a small 3d printed insert to protect it. There are clear shields available you can place over the screen. I cut an unused kindle screen protector to shape and place it on mine. It does not seem to affect the touch screen accuracy.  

If you press the power button several times it says it is turning the reader off. While it is supposedly off  if you have a low that is below the threshold you selected for the low alarm it will alert.  The lost signal alarm does stay off and I have not had a high while the alarm is off so do not know if that one also is still active. I turned the device off because it kept alerting to compression lows because I had the sensor in a location that I tended to sleep on.

Compression lows happen if you roll over onto the sensor. It will drop into the 50’s and if you have the low alarm turned on it will alert whenever it crosses the threshold you set. I used to waste a test strip when that happened but now wait 15 minutes, if I see the reading rising go back to sleep. I do try to place the sensor in locations where I am not apt to cause this problem

Sensor location matters for more than compression lows. Certain places like the outside of your upper arms are easier to knock the sensor off while remove clothing or bumping into objects like doorframes.

I keep mine in the locations shown by Abbott as where to place it but do avoid placing them towards the outside of the arm. I found it is easy to place them if I hold my arm out with the upper part level with my shoulder and the lower arm pointed up. Keeping the muscles as relaxed as possible I press the applicator against the chosen spot and press and hold a few seconds than pull the applicator away. Places on the arm where you could inject insulin are a good spot for the sensor.

Before I place the sensor the location is prepped. It there is hair it is shaved off and the area cleaned well with a paper towel dampened with alcohol. Then Skin-Tac is applied to the skin and allowed to dry. After it is dry the sensor applicator is then pressed to the skin and applied. After a few seconds the applicator is removed then I look over the sensor in the mirror. If the band on the outside is lifted or does not look right you could use a spoon or butter knife to smooth it down. I found a 3d printed item on Thingiverse what works nicely. It fits over the sensor and pushes the band down. 

For mine I place a cover over it with a Simpatch patch with the hole holding it down. Then using the alcohol moistened paper towel clean up the excess Skin-Tac from my arm.  This protects the sensor against the accidental bump and so far I have been able to get the full 14 days out of the patch. They do look a bit frayed towards the end.  If you use a patch and the end lifts for some reason Skin-Tac smeared under it then allowed to dry before the patch is pushed down helps to reattach them.

Since at least for me the sensor is not real accurate the first 24 hours so I place the next sensor on my arm the day before the previous one expires. After the old one is removed the new one is then activated. This seems to help and the extra day on the arm so far has not affected the accuracy.

And they are not all accurate, usually mine will be close often well within 10% of test strip readings but I have had occasional sensors that were way off.  If it does not clear up in a day its time to call Abbott and get it replaced.  

So far Abbott has been easy to deal with on replacing defective sensors. I have had 3 replaced so far. Two that were way off staying 40 to 50 points below test strips and one that stopped working 5 days in.

As far as test strips to verify the sensor. I am lucky and feel lows so if the reader alarms for a low and I am not feeling it I ignore it now. If I am feeling effects of a low and the sensor alarms it’s time to eat a treat. Highs so far have been accurate with the sensor. Even so if the high alarm goes off I do check before I correct. My test strip usage has gone way down and is usually just a few strips a week now.

 If you are on Medicare like me they do not want to allow test strips along with the sensors. The Endo and I were able to get Medicare to allow 50 of the Freestyle Neo test strips sent with the two sensors each month by showing the literature from Abbott says to check before you correct.  I was buying them before and they are not that expensive but having them included is a plus. 

The data the device give me is very useful. I learned how some things like bike riding into a wind or certain foods affect me as well as when to give a dose before some meals. I used to always do it 20 minutes before and found with some of the meals I eat the fats and protein slow the digestion down enough to cause my blood sugars to dip into the 60’s at times before they climb. And others are almost like instant rise.

Hope someone finds this useful and any others who have some good information please chime in. I’m always up to learning more on how to keep my condition under control.

60,"So… I recently failed a postpartum OGTT in the “prediabetic” range (194 after 1 hour, 164 after 2 hours). I took it at 8 weeks postpartum (I’m now 13w PP), following gestational diabetes where I was diet-controlled. I did not have GD with my first pregnancy 2 years ago.

After the OGTT results, I was concerned about LADA because I’m not overweight and was metabolically healthy 2 years ago, so I asked my regular doctor to run antibody tests. She also ran fasting insulin and c-peptide.

Antibodies were negative.
Fasting glucose was 78. 
Fasting Insulin was 2.9. 
C-peptide was .84. 
A1C was 4.9 (however, I’ve been testing and eating low carb and losing my pregnancy weight). 

I have ketones in urine, despite a carb intake around 75g per day, possibly bc I walk an hour a day and am breastfeeding. 

I’ve been “eating to my meter”, but noticed that my carb tolerance seems to be decreasing rather quickly. A month ago, I could eat 2 slices of whole wheat toast with no problem. Yesterday, I spiked up to 154 (after 1 hour) from a hamburger on a whole wheat bun. I was back down to 108 at 2 hours, but I don’t understand why 20g of carbs is now spiking me when I was fine with it just a few weeks ago. Can I be losing pancreatic cell function this quickly?!

Changed my diet and sugar levels have been good all month.  Lab glucose test last week was 96.  Home glucose avg has been 118 over the 30 days, and 107 last 7 days (I’m still learning what I can and can’t eat).  All based on 4 tests a day.

I haven't used a pump in about 20 years due to how bad my first experience with one was was.  With that being said, loop systems sound amazing and I'd like a bit more freedom / control - so I'm considering the OmniPod to be used with my Dexcom G6.  I realize the loop system aspect isn't in play yet - but after speaking to their rep, it sounds like the pre-existing customers will be getting first dibs on the roll out which should be happening around the end of this year or beginning of next year.


So, for those who use it or have tried it - what are your thoughts on it?  What did you like and what did you dislike?  And would you mind sharing any tips / tricks that you learned that made using it easier / more enjoyable?


For those curious, the reason I won't go the route of a traditional pump again:

* Toddler + 3 large dogs + cat = tubing nightmare.  I am also ""accident prone"" - my first experience with having tubing lead to a lot of pain with doorknobs that I don't want to repeat.
* Hypertrophy - I have 2 areas on my stomach that have fat buildup that won't go away from when I used a pump previously.  My doc said it's more common in kids than adults, so I shouldn't worry as much about it... but the pods being able to be used in more areas gives me a bit more peace of mind.",diabetes,OmniPod Experiences / Tips / Tricks?,1627314724

I struggled to adjust, because after years of living your life normally, its incredibly hard to make such a change. After 5 years of having it, I still struggle to maintain myself. When Covid hit, and everyone was quarantined, I wasn't able to afford my medications even with insurance. But even before Covid-19 was a thing, I was rehospitalized for DKA in 2019. At the time, i was working full time at a job that I couldnt stand, but still lived with my parents, and with a father that really wasnt much of a father. My parents were officially getting divorced, and we were in the process of selling the house. Everyday I went to work upset, but also didn't want to be home. Looking back it's kind of a lame excuse, but I just didn't see any reason to try to care for myself. I was ignoring my sugars and basically eating crappy food without actually taking insulin. I guess in my mind I was hoping my body would just fail and I would die because of it. I was for sure in a deep depression.

Once I finally moved away from all the issues from my dad, I eventually fell into DKA and was on the verge of a fatal episode. I was saved, spent a few days in the hospital getting my body readjusted. My blood was so acidic that they basically flushed my body out and replenished it with the necessary vitamins and fluids.

That was two years ago, and when Covid hit, my hours were cut and I was unable to afford my medication and rent at the same time. I made the decision to cut back on my meds, and also my food intake as to save on insulin. But eventually I stopped buying my Libre blood sugar readers. In other words, I was winging it. Basing everything on how i feel.

I recently have started a new job after my vaccination, and am able to afford ally medications. And it may have been just in time. I had been feeling incredibly off for a long time, and I knew it had to be because of my decisions to roll back on my food intake and prescriptions.

I've been somewhat able to keep myself under control, but I have recently got a nasty couple of cuts and scabs on my right shin from work, and now it looks like my foot is infected.

So Abbot sent me a new kit and I'm going to be mailing out the reject tomorrow. However, now I installed my new libre, making sure that my skin was dry after my shower 3 hours before, on the upper right back of the arm with no stretch marks, moles, scars etc, and it's saying I'm hypoglycemic again, saying I'm 66 but a stick test says I'm 96.

Around 6 months before then, i think in jan or feb I was at a family reuinoin and I had a lot of skor bars (My aunt made really good skor bars) but the next morning I had thrown up for about an hour. I figured that may have been ketones, and that may have been the day I was diagnosed. Plus my a1C when I was diagnosed was over 22Mmol/l and that would be excleast 3 months with an average of 22. So is it even possible for someone to be at a high sugar of 22mmol for 6 months. I drink pretty much only diet pops and I didnt have treats often, ate healthy too. I had lost around 80 pounds  before being diagnosed so I clearly had ketones. I just dont think that I couldve been at such a high number for so long and not gone into dka. I had been diagnosed because of a blood test because of my lost weight. So in the end I didnt even go into dka.",diabetes,Is it weird to think that I had ketones for 6 months without going into dka?,1627233338

I don't have a GMS yet, but I manage to keep my BS under control very well (last hypo: 1 week ago, last hyper: right after that hypo but that was my fault). In my country i can apply to get a free GSM (I have already applied to med care to get one and i am on the waiting list), and/or a just as free pump (also my insulin and BS tests are free). I have two closed loop options: Medtronic MiniMed 640G and a random AccuCheck one (i don't know the model because they are silent af). 

For me i don't really see pumps as a must have thing because i keep my BS and A1c under control and i am not bothered by the multiple daily injections. But i have heard of the new closed loop pumps and i changed my mind a little bit: If it only helps me to control what i already manage to control myself i'll pass because i think it is just another thing that i have to constantly charge and look after, but the ideea of an artificial pancreas that actualy helps me get linear BS, well that would be a perk i really wish for, so i can achieve a ""0% diabetes"" experience.

I think i will damage it or get tangled up in the insulin tube. Also, i have an active sex life (hope i don't have to #nsfw this for mentioning that) and i have no ideea how i would go about having a pump in these situations...

I'm 23(F) and today my family doctor called and said my blood sugar is kinda high , for someone who fasted 12 hours before doing it . 

Let me tell you why I did it at first place so you get the idea .

Well my uncle who is diabetic came to visit noticed 3 liter bottle on my table . At first he found it funny and even said it's good that I'm hydrating and stuff . But when he noticed I drank the whole thing in like 1 hour and went to get another one he went like yo wtf , do you drink those for a sport or what . And my answer is that I'm thirsty. He asked if i did some blood tests recently and made me go do one . 
Me drinking that much water came suddenly tbh . I was never this thirty. I mean I was but recently it's unbearable. Like just now I drank 1.5 liters and NOTHING.  Its like I drank nothing at all. My mouth is dry, my throat is dry ... As for peeing I didn't notice that I'm peeing that much . Like proportional to the amount I drink I guess , and it doesn't seem to frequent. 
Oh and I'm kinda always feeling like I have a cold or something. 

Doc said that it's urgent to go visit him tomorrow,  but didn't give me any details. 
Why I posted here in first place is because I have no idea about diabetes,  or how to deal with it if I had it . 
That is what I wanted to ask you guys . What about workouts,  should I visit like cardiologist too if it turns out I have it ( i know it can damage the heart ) ?

This problem is compounded in my head because as an american living in Sweden, I have been researching both Swedish and American web sites, and they are giving some contradictory information.  For example, Swedish web site says potatoes and pasta are fine, American web sites say no.  Many American web sites say low carb while this is not the same advice given on the Swedish web sites.  There are also contradictions between advice given at web sites within the same country.  I am so confused regarding what I should be eating, as it appears that professionals in the diabetic care community themselves can't seem to come to any agreement internally on what constitutes a proper diet.  Which is pretty sad in my opinion.  So..., please, anyone have any ideas on how to determine what I should and should not eat?

8,"I have posted here a bit of late and thought I should at least share with you my background and what brought me here.  


I am 58, overweight and of course diabetic. I was diagnosed when I was 32, I made some simple adjustments like switching to diet soda and only having ice cream once a week and went on with my life. My A1C was consistently 10 to 12 over the years and I just settled in and figure that was what it was going to be.  That was until this year.

Valentines day morning 2021 I woke with my heart racing and trouble drawing a deep breath. I got up to go to the bathroom and could not find the handle on the door. My heart would not slow down so my wife took me down to the ER. 

They found I was in the middle of a severe DKA episode. This was ugly bad, they asked my wife if she could reach my kids if needed. I was laying in the emergency room bed, not knowing what was going on. I recall seeing my wife and the nurse seeming to spend a lot of time chatting in the doorway. I figured at the time my wife, who is very outgoing, was passing time. I did not know until later that the nurse was told to not leave my room.

When they took me upstairs they had wanted to put me in the ICU but the local hospital was full up. Instead they put me in a normal room and assigned a nurse to JUST my room for the night. I thought I was just getting excellent care. He told me the next day that they did not think I would make it through the night. 

The next 4 days were awful, I was living on ice chips and IVs. They explained that my body chemistry was basically be reset. My body was wracked with pain and I could not lay in bed, I lived in a recliner. I was getting an hours sleep, wake for two and then sleep an hour again. 

On day 5 they let me have some real food for the first time, I ate about 4 bites and was done. Day 6 they sent me home. If I thought the 5 days at the hospital where bad, the next 3 months at home where worse. I had no strength and could barely walk to the bathroom and back. I was in a constant state of pain, living on over the counter pain killers. The first night I slept for more than an hour was heavenly, but I was usually up 3 or 4 times minimum throughout the night for an hour or more. 

Early June I started to feel, better. I was able to do more for myself and my energy levels began to return. They had changed ALL my meds. Gone where all my diabetic meds, I am only on Lantus and Humalog. I am now monitoring blood sugar 7 to 10 times a day and cannot have more than about 50 carbs for a meal. I have had to get very serious about what I eat.

Despite feeling much better, I am finding now to be the hardest part of all of this. My body is craving me to go back to how things where before. My appetited has returned and I have to forces myself to have control, something that just was before a few weeks ago. I am up and more active, though still not like I was. I can now sleep most nights, though tonight my body just wants to stay awake, no pain just wants to be awake. 

My A1C in early May was 6.2 and I have another one coming up. This experience has been a huge wakeup call for me and I hope my tail makes others take notice. I am getting a second chance, the doctor has told me that by letting my diabetes go uncontrolled for so long they expected me to have a ton of things wrong with my. My eyes and feet are in great shape, my heart is strong and liver and kidney functions are all near perfect. I dodged a bullet.

Let this is a cautionary tale, if you find out your diabetic, take control NOW. It is not easy but will be worth it down the road. I told my son the other day the way to describe how I dealt with diabetes is this.. ""I loaded the gun, chambered a round, pointed it at my head and cocked the hammer, daring the world to pull the trigger."" Well it did and by the grace of God I am still here. 

Typing this all out is reminding me how lucky I have been. Please do yourselves a favor, do my rely on luck. I wish I had known before what I know now. That's why I pass this on to everyone I meet.

Like most people, I was overly familiar with Type 2 diabetes and didn’t realize the significant difference from Type 1, as such, this has been a huge learning curve for me.

Up until today, I haven’t had many complaints; I just figured this is my new normal. My partner has been beyond supportive, overtly optimistic, and has been hands on when requested (i.e. he’ll give me my insulin when I’m sometimes too hesitant myself) I don’t mean to complain, but his optimism feels almost dismissive so I was a bit annoyed today. I’m an easy going person so it was truly just a slight annoyance- which I vocalized because we’re open communicators. 

Like I mentioned, I’ve just been going with the flow. Grateful to be alive, grateful to have insurance, grateful to have an understanding employer (I’m taking some FMLA time off to adjust to my new normal), grateful that everyone on my medical care team has made me feel empowered and knowledgeable. There have been some minor negative thoughts in my mind (why me? Why now right before my birthday? Why right before I’m starting a PhD program? Etc.) but I feel like I’ve been managing it well up until today.

I finally had a bit of energy to entertain my hobbies, so I go to play my Switch (my animal crossing island has been neglected). My joycon was acting weird and I couldn’t even press the release button to reattach it because my fingertips hurt SO bad (I was pricked every hour at the hospital my entire stay and while my at home kit isn’t as painful, my fingertips are simply shot at the moment). The inability to press a stupid button on my own caused a major breakdown. I cried and cried and cried. 

Thus far, I felt like I could manage my new normal, but today, the frustration is unreal. It’s frustrating that most people are familiar with Type 2 so they don’t understand the severity of Type 1. It’s frustrating that I’m suddenly doing so much mental math. It’s frustrating feeling so alone, as I don’t know anyone with Type 1. I’m hoping today is just one of those days and that I can get back to my normal, relaxed state of being, but I’m worried that with this new way of life, I’ll have more of these days. There are so many people who have dealt with this since childhood and so many others that suffer under the costs, so I know I have no right to complain.

Any good recipes for making cakes? Making them vegan is easy enough; milk is substituted for coconut milk, buttermilk is substituted for almond milk with a couple teaspoons of lemon juice, egg is substituted for flax seeds.

One piece of toast will do it. Just one. Croutons on a salad will do it. I grew up on a diet of things like pasta, hamburgers, pizza... You know, normal food for normal kids. I never ate much candy anyway. I am still bright and chipper, even when my numbers are at levels that would cause others to ""panic"" . Ive never had a hypo that I couldnt fix up myself with a quick dose of candy. I have been admitted for dka once, but that was because I was sloppy with my insulin routines for a few weeks. Lesson learned I guess - life sucks get used to it.   


Ive tried the FreeStyle system before and they always leave me with an infection at the site around the 10 day mark. I wanted to try a Dexcom, and started the process of trying to obtain one. However for a while I had moved in with my parents on the Island of Hawaii (because I could no longer afford to live on my own) . On that island in particular, there is no endocrinologist whatsoever. Infact, my GP was only on the island two days out of the week, and so overloaded with patients that I was unable to see him for 3-6 month spans at a time. Often being told that my existing appointments had to be rescheduled.   


Why the hell does Dexcom insist you show them months and months of finger sticks before they will allow you a device? ISNT THE POINT OF CGM TO ALLOW FOR LESS STICKS?!!! It should NOT be up to an insurance company to decide if you deserve a device that might save your career or life just because they dont want to pay for something that costs about the equivalent of an iPhone. Now at this point I no longer qualify for the insurance plan under my father, and am down to medicaid which bucks like a mule at even paying for insulin. Forget a CGM.   


So here I am, years later, without a career in aviation, trying to get by on peasant wages, loosing hope for the future that once seemed so bright. I really wish our world would put the same energy into developing medical advancements as they do at further enriching millionaires. I miss being ""a normie"" . I miss orange juice and waffles. I miss milk. Dont assume I am in a bad mental state, Im fine. Just deflated and tired of it all.

At 5 months post-partum, I had lost a whole bunch of weight (down to 125 lbs) and I started feeling bizarre - brain fog/light headedness, blurred vision, fatigue, dizzy and nauseous. I tested my BG and I was at 27 mmol/L BEFORE dinner. After a trip to the ER, they diagnosed me as Type 2 diabetic with an A1C of 9.4% and started me on 2,000mg daily of Metformin and 10u of Lantus before bed.

At my first appointment with my endo, she seemed convinced that I was type 2 since my fasting and post-meal BG was within normal range. So clearly responding to that treatment. However, I pretty much went on a keto diet because I was desperate to decrease my A1C. I barely eat any carbs, and when I do, I spike like crazy (1/2 of a whole wheat pita will bring to me 14 mmol/L, 2 hours after a meal). I insisted that I be tested for anti-bodies, given that Type 2 just doesn't make sense for my profile (no fam history of T2, not overweight, active, etc.) and that I have a family history of T1D (sibling). She was reluctant, but agreed. 

I got my result and my value was &gt;250 IU/mL!!!

So my questions are :

1- Is a positive anti-body test enough to diagnose LADA and is &gt;250 IU/mL a really high result?

2- For anyone with LADA, how quickly did you become insulin dependent for meals?

Apparently diabetics (untreated and in some cases even those who are well-managed) metabolise drugs *differently* from non diabetics. Things like aspirin are broken down differently in diabetics, which is what I gleaned from the research article I actually found afterwards corroborating the stuff in the episode.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a scientist and for the most part what I gleaned from the research article was that diabetics *definitely* do process drugs differently, including asperin (oddly enough I also found a Diabetes UK article about that specifically as well), but at the very least, at least there might be some benefits to this disease.

Good news first - got my HBA1C result today and I'm 7.8 which is down from 8.7 three months ago. Not perfect yet but that's the lowest it's been in years, probably since diagnosis, so I'm pleased as a punch.

Anyway, onto the topic at hand - how on earth do I do an MDI basal test while struggling with feet on the floor syndrome? My understanding of an MDI basal test in the morning is to inject my morning basal as usual, and if my blood rises by 2.0 mmol/L or more then my basal is too low. However, within about 30 minutes of getting out of bed, my blood rises about 5.0 mmol/L every single morning due to feet on the floor syndrome, so the test is kind of already ruined.

Now I'm 25 at a healthy bmi and even with me getting even more into shape shit just ain't right. The most confusing part is that my fasting glucose is ideal, somewhere around 4.6 consistingly, but when I do the OGTT it's around 9 and it won't drop almost at all after 2 hours.

Thanks to all of you for sharing your experience and advice; it's been wonderful to, through the sadness of the diagnosis and all the worry and frankly mourning that came afterward, listen to other people's struggles and successes and stories.

My NP didn't want to put me on drugs yet, instead opting to try to manage it just through diet and exercise, so I've been exercising more and have been eating pretty low carb since then (usually less than 50 a day; when I met with my nutritionist last week she strongly suggested raising that/not being quite so militantly and anxiously restrictive about carbs as I had been, and honestly it'd be lovely to be able to push that number up). Yesterday I got a Dario meter more for my own peace of mind for anything else—I've spent the past few weeks pretty worried that every single thing I feel in my body must be diabetes or its complications. Twitch in my eye? RETINOPATHY HAS COME FOR ME AT LAST.

First few metered readings were pretty reassuring—my fasting this morning was 90, vs. 121 from four weeks ago when I was diagnosed, for example. Figuring that I could finally take the advice from the sub to eat to my meter now that I had one, for lunch today I had two eggs scrambled in leftover bacon fat from breakfast, probably one to one and a half cups of a cucumber and tomato salad, and an actual honest-to-God packed single (but hefty) scoop of very sweet (peanut butter and chocolate) ice cream, wondering how much the veggies, protein, and fat might help mitigate the spike.

Blood sugar before I ate lunch was 100. My blood sugar one and a half hours after finishing the ice cream was 88. I didn't believe it, and so in an almost farcical series of events as I tested again, sometimes failed to get enough blood to test, squeezed probably too much in one reading, increased the depth of the prick so as not to squeeze, changed lancets, increased the depth of the prick all the way to the maximum, and pricked pretty much all of my fingers, I ended up with these readings over the course of half an hour: 

88, 98, 97, 76 (that was the squeezer), 101, and 106

Another half an hour after that, it was 103. Aside from obviously needing to buy some stock in testing strip companies, I'm a little concerned that that... can't be right? Is my meter wildly inaccurate? I know that's a question that can really only be answered with control solution, which I don't yet have. Or are these readings possible? It seems like even if there weren't a spike, the measured value should still be higher. (And it's not that my meter's never showing high values; after a higher-carb-than-my-recent-usual dinner last night I was 165.) I understand that this post could come off as humblebraggy, but I assure you it's instead confusion and a certain hesitancy to feel relief after weeks of thinking that something like an honest-to-God dessert wouldn't be possible for me ever again, at least not without simultaneously worrying about what it was doing to me.

**TLDR: Newly diagnosed T2 eats a small portion of dessert and kind of doesn't believe the lack of a spike, and wonders if his meter or collection procedures could be to blame or if it is in fact possible to relax and have a scoop of ice cream sometimes.**",diabetes,Could these readings be accurate?,1626820333

I do not have cholesterol issues and I do not, by choice, eat red meat including pork.  I told all of this to the nutritionist.

I told them that I eat two eggs, 1 slice of turkey bacon, and a slice of whole grain toast for breakfast every morning, protein-heavy lunch (i.e. chicken of some kind, fish, or turkey chili.) I have salad with avocado for dinner.  Sometimes I'll have a second slice of toast.  I also eat nuts every day.  

Roughly 25% of my diet is from carbs.

They advised that the eggs were bad for me because of the saturated fat, but that nuts and avocado were fine. I could eat egg whites, but not the yolk.  They suggested the turkey bacon was bad because it's processed and also the fat (what fat?  It's turkey).  They said I needed to eliminate as much animal based protein as possible and avoid dark meat.  (Reminder, I do not eat red meat.)

They also said 25% carbs was too low and that I should aim for 40%, but they had to be good carbs.

I am scratching my head because this doesn't line up with what my doctor told me about diabetes.  Specifically, my doctor said I may have to further lower my carbs if my a1c didn't improve.

Cholesterol fell from 227 mg/dL to 178 mg/dL, and triglyceride level fell from 372 mg/dL to 124 mg/dL. My weight went from 291 pounds to 276 pounds.

I haven't been tested in a bit over a month, but I currently weigh 260 pounds so I am kind of hoping the numbers will be better.

Since the initial diagnosis, I have absolutely abstained from all kinds of sugar and adopted a strict 23:1 fasting diet seven days a week. I actually am pretty used to it by now and I like the food I'm eating, although it's just an hour a day.

37,"I just want to say right off the bat that this is not a “please diagnose me” post; it’s more of a “how can I talk to my doctor about what is happening to me in a way that is actually effective because the way I’m doing it is not” post/maybe a little bit of a vent. 

I’ve had what I would describe as… poor blood sugar control? For a long time. Since 2014-2015 at least. I went to my university health center probably 4 years ago because I was having frequent sugar crashes, dizzy spells, exhaustion, vision issues (sometimes it just.. goes away for a minute and then returns.) &amp; excessive thirst. I’ll have a huge drink and it’ll be gone in no time at all, and I still want more to drink right after. I pee a lot, but I don’t know how frequently is an “abnormal” amount to pee, especially since I drink a lot. I would say I have to pee at least once an hour, often more. 

The university nurse took my blood sugar level when I went in and it came back in range for someone who wasn’t fasting. She didn’t order a fasting test. I wasn’t feeling unwell when I went if that’s relevant (it was a scheduled appointment).

She told me I was fine, healthier than I think I am, and sent me on my way. I have continued to have these symptoms ever since. I’m always, ALWAYS hungry and if I don’t bring a snack with me wherever I go I have to worry that I’m going to get dizzy or sick. When I get sick I’ll start sweating, feel like I can barely stand, shake, and have rapid breathing and heart rate. My therapist said that maybe I’m not good at noticing my body’s hunger signals until I’m starving so I started seeing a nutritionist to help me plan my meals. The nutritionist said I was more aware of what I eat in a day than most people and that I don’t really need her. I wasn’t surprised because I have to be aware of food all the time. If I don’t think about it I’ll get sick.

This went on for years without progressing really but also without improving. I admit I was eating a bit better pre-pandemic and did not drink soda, which seemed to help a little with the nausea and shakiness. However, I started having problems with my hands and feet around January of this year. It started when I woke up with wrist pain and dull pain in one foot, then progressed to a burning/tingling sensation in my hands and feet, and eventually frequent bouts of numbness in my arms and legs. There’s a trigger point in my foot that sends electric shock type pain down my foot when pressed. I thought maybe I have rheumatoid arthritis since my grandma did and I got checked for it, but the tests came back normal except for slightly high blood sugar, but not high enough that my doctor was concerned (blood glucose at 115). 

I started to feel like my vision is not sharp even when I’m wearing glasses. I figured my prescription was out of date but went to the optometrist for my annual and was given a new one. My vision still doesn’t seem clear to me and I can’t read from a few feet away. Occasionally I see sparkling lights or little red spots in my vision like someone is putting a piece of red plastic over part of my eye. My optometrist dilated my pupils and said my retinas look great so whatever is happening there is being caused by something else. 

I started going to physical therapy for the joint issues. One time I went without eating beforehand because I just didn’t have enough time. My physical therapist asked me to do an exercise for my back where I lay on my stomach on an exercise ball and lift weights in a T. This was not a super high impact exercise at all but since I didn’t eat first I started to sweat a lot and was visibly shaking when I stood up/I needed to sit down. My physical therapist did not think that was normal and asked if I was diabetic. I said no, because I’m not diagnosed as being diabetic, but I told him this is a frequent thing for me. 

This is all still happening, and I feel certain that something is not right. But every time I go to the doctor they don’t believe me, or don’t find anything, or don’t run the right test, and I feel like I just look crazy to them. I started setting up an appointment today then stopped because I don’t want to go through being told it’s in my head again and I genuinely don’t want to waste my doctor’s time if that’s what I am doing. 

Is there anything I can do on my own to make my doctor listen to me? Should I get a blood glucometer even though my BG levels don’t read “high enough” by my doctor’s standards &amp; keep track for a bit before I make an appointment? Is there a specific test I should know to ask for? &amp; Is it possible or common to have diabetes and get a normal/barely high BG reading? 

TL;DR: I have a history of symptoms but I’m not getting anywhere with my doctor even though I constantly feel terrible.

Then my BG will drop and continue to drop for a long time, no matter how much sugar I ingest, as if nothing is absorbing (with a skyrocketing BG hours later if I go overboard).


I do intermittent fasting five days a week and this happens on both fasting nights and non-fasting nights, and began before the fasting was introduced. 


This happens whether I have insulin on board or not. The basal rate is fine throughout the day and I set it to 80% at bedtime or sometimes well before in an attempt to circumvent the issue. It’s really like flipping a switch as soon as the nausea starts.


When it happens, I feel the need to vomit, which fortunately I have not yet (thanks to pink bismuth). But still I am awake for 1-2 hours trying to get everything stabilized or haunting the bathroom.

Just for context, I am 17 years old and was diagnosed with Type 1 in November (I was 16 at the time). In about September 2020, I stopped playing competitive soccer/football due to Covid and such, and prior to this I had very good stamina and would only start feeling tired near the end of games (so about 70-80 minutes in). 

I have now started playing soccer again just for fun with some of my friends, and now as a Type 1 diabetic my energy levels are brutal. I could barely play for 20 minutes without feeling really dead. 

Before anyone starts blaming glucose levels, I have a CGM, and was between 6 and 9 mmol/L for the entire game.

So my question is, am I just rusty from not having played ""official"" soccer for about a year? Or does it have something to do with being diabetic and the amount of insulin my body has during the game?

29,"I want to preface this by saying if I’m T2, I’m completely fine with that. I’m not fighting it, I’m not in denial. The facts just seem to not line up and I am a little concerned I’m being shoved into a T2 diagnosis when I need insulin. 

Until I got COVID at the end of January, I have been healthy, regularly see doctors (for like sinus infections, flu, etc.). I had a child in 2016 and a super healthy pregnancy, passed glucose test, only gained 12 pounds in pregnancy. 

After having COVID, I just never felt good again. In mid April I started what would be a 4 week period and rapid unexplained weight loss of 10 lbs/week for 4 weeks and went to the gyno where full labs were done and my A1C was 12.5% and fasted glucose of 455. I immediately put myself on a super strict NO CARB, NO SUGAR diet. A couple of days later I felt incredibly sick and went to the ER where my glucose was 380 hours after eating and being on a strict diet. I was able to see my primary about a week later and she started me with Metformin and Toujeo (long acting). 

Now, 6 weeks later, I am taking 65 units of Toujeo a day and about 10 units of Humalog and my fasting glucose is 80-90 and post meal is 120-140. I have still, in the last 6 weeks, been NO SUGAR (if you look in my post history you will see I ate a cookie once 😂) and VERY low carb, under 50g carbs a day definitely. 

My GAD65 shows no elevated antibody levels. My endo wants me to come off insulin. I don’t understand how that’s best for me? Also, the labs my gyno initially ran showed my liver numbers were TERRIBLE. But no one has addressed that so I don’t know how that could play into this. 

And I don’t know how I could have lost 40 lbs, I’ve lost 10lbs since, I’m adhering to the strictest diet but it’s pretty clear my body isn’t producing insulin adequately? But I assume the argument is that I’m giving it too much insulin?

83,"The relevance/importance of this number as a health marker can be glimpsed from the following statement:

 [Mark has a fasting blood triglyceride level of 100 mg/dL and an HDL-cholesterol level of 50 mg/dL. His Triglyceride:HDL ratio is 100 / 50 = 2. Low ratio values such as this one indicate good insulin sensitivity; which means that insulin is doing a great job helping to move glucose and amino acids from the blood into your cells. It also means that you have a relatively low risk of developing prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, low ratios indicate that you have the relatively innocuous ‘large and fluffy’ LDL cholesterol type, which makes you less prone to coronary heart disease (CHD). On the other hand, let’s say that your blood triglycerides were 240 mg/dL and your HDL was 30 mg/dL. Some quick math tells us that the ratio this time is 8. This is a high ratio, suggesting that you are insulin resistant. Simply put, even though you are producing insulin, too much glucose is remaining in the blood. As a result, you have a relatively high risk of developing prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. A high ratio also tends to indicate that you have the more sinister ‘small and dense’ LDL cholesterol type, which makes you more prone to coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke.](https://www.cooperinstitute.org/2017/11/28/cardiorespiratory-fitness-the-triglyceridehdl-ratio-and-coronary-heart-disease-mortality-risk-in-men)",diabetes,Triglycerides to HDL ratio,1626427238

- Hemoglobin A1C (not sure what this means, but saw it’s a metric for diabetes): 4.7%

She told me I needed to stop my insulin for a day of and make sure my blood sugar was 200-250mg/dl. So I skipped my long acting insulin and my insulin for breakfast and I ate some candy on top of that until I was hyper (and sick) and then I walked 15 minutes to the lab.

... and my blood sugar plummeted to 150mg/dl all on its own and I had a surprisingly hard time getting it back up.

Now during these months, I’ve had to lower my doses A LOT because I kept getting lower readings each time, 2 days ago I stopped taking insulin and I’m around 70-80 every time both before breakfast and after meals.

By eating let's say a pizza which is around 200g of carbs I get around 180-200mg/dL while she get around 120-130mg/dL in the first test (1.5h after eating), while in the second test (3h after eating) I get 80mg/dL while she stays around 110-120mg/dL.

I checked my Dexcom App and noticed that \~20 minutes after I ate that snack and fell asleep, my Blood Sugar dropped significantly, Below 40.

 An artificial pancreas which regulates insulin provision in people with type one diabetes will soon undergo tests involving 240 patients at 12 Dutch hospitals, thanks to government funding. The device, developed by inventor Robin Koops, himself a diabetes patient, consists of a glucose meter which measures the amount of insulin on a permanent basis and a small pump. If the amount of insulin is too high the pump will administer insulin. If it is too low glucagon is administered. Both hormones regulate blood sugar values which tend to fluctuate in patients with type one diabetes. The government advisory group Zorginstituut Nederland and care innovation organisation ZonMw have together put up a €10m grant to run the test which comes in the wake of a smaller scale experiment using the device. Some of the 30 people who already put the artificial pancreas to the test were reluctant to return the device because they had never felt so well, a spokesman for Utrecht teaching hospital told broadcaster NOS. If the device proves equally successful the second time around, many will be able to manage their insulin levels more efficiently, researchers hope. Some 100,000 people in the Netherlands suffer from the immune disease. Koops, who spent 15 years working on his invention, managed to bring down the size of the device from a small fridge to a box no bigger than two smart phones piled on top of each other.",diabetes,€10bn for major test of artificial pancreas developed by Dutch inventor,1626187091

Now, my last 2 blood works have come back as 6.0 A1C in April, and 6.3 A1C this  month.   
The doctor (she is new) says I have nothing to worry about, because those numbers are still good. My old doctor always wanted me under 6.0, because he felt that the longer you are below 6 the better controlled your diabetes is and his goal (and mine) was to never have to take insulin. The new doctor says below 7 should be my goal, and diabetes gets worse with age and there's probably no way to eventually avoid insulin. She says that if I lose the 20 pounds it might make a difference in the A1C, and then tried to sell me on using her office's dietician. She also said I could go to 2000mg of metformin if I wanted, but she wouldn't bump me to 1250 or 1500 because it was too hard to prescribe that kind of dosage.

I was diagnosed with T1D in April and have since been trying my best to get my sugars into normal ranges.

However, everytime I start to go below 7-6 mmol/l I start seeing an abstract pattern in the center of my vision (sort of misformed triangles?) that look like the spots you get after looking at a bright light that flash when looking somewhere else/blinking.

The second I go higher than 7 it goes away completely.

19,"Everytime I learn something new about my diabetes it's based on trial and error. For example I just learned that I shouldn't eat carbs before taking my long acting insulin even if it is 30 minutes before I take it. I ate some chicken nuggets last night and I was fine. Then about 30 minutes later I take my insulin. Immediately after I was so damn hungry. I didn't feel like eating anything again because usually when I do get really hungry and try to eat I can just never get full. 

So I left it alone and went to bed. Currently almost 5 am and now I am burping a lot. Which is not a good sign. Since I've been diagnosed I noticed that whenever I start burping a lot and it tasted sweet yet acidic 9/10 it means I will throw up. I absolutely hate puking. It's even worse now because my whole body feels it. Sometimes it is so bad that (WARNING TMI) that it triggers me to poop.

Here's our current situation - last night her blood glucose level was over 500 mg/dL after not having any food for at least 3 hours. This morning it was 290. We've had this glucose meter for 2 days, so not much of a pattern to base decisions on, but is this in any way ""normal?"" Everything I read online is saying she needs to go to the ER. I believe her breath has the rotten fruit smell of larges ketones, but we don't have a ketone meter.

Here's our diabetes story so far.

* 2 weeks ago we got diagnosed with diabetes. They immediately started her on an insulin pill in the morning and night, as well of a nightly injection of 10 units of insulin.
* Oh, and the doctor called that same day and told us we should go to the ER because her tryglicerites were over 1000.
* At the ER, all they did was take a blood sample and send us home. She didn't feel abnormal or sick so they didn't seem too concerned.
* We've been doing the medication as prescribed for 5 days as we wait for the pharmacy to give us our glucose meter.
* We've had the meter for 2 days so far. The first day it was high, I believe it never dropped below the 200's
* Last night I told her to increase her injection to 12 units and see if that lowers it in the morning. The doctor said we can play with the dosage to get it under control.
* This morning I had her inject another 5 units. After a few hours her glucose went from 290 to 270. Still very high it seems, especially for no food yet.

We're new to this. I have her going to her doctor today and see if they can measure her ketones or something. I don't know if her insulin is fast acting.

Yesterday, I was at a friend's house for some BBQ, which was about a 2 hour drive from my home. I change my pump set and the Insulin just before, and then jumped in my car. My bs was good during the drive, at about 6-7, all good. I got to my friends house, ate some BBQ, and Ice Cream (Bolused about 10 mins before we started eating). I then checked my CGM 30 mins later. And it said 15 and three arrows up. I was like ""How??"" I did bolus correctly. I took a correction dose, and 30 mins later, 21 and still 3 arrows up.

I finally figured out that i probably was not receiving any insulin at all. I panicked, since I was 2 hours from home where all the Insulin and infusion sets where. I quickly said good bye to my friends and jumped in the car. I drove way over the speed limit the whole way, while monitoring the CGM, it was now at 26 and still going up. I started to feel nausea and weak (Classic signs of DKA) and I still had an hour left to drive. By the time I got home, I was at my highest ever level: 32. I changed the infusion set, took a very large amount of Insulin. 

I then checked by ketone level, which were at 1.5, so I figured it was just a matter of time before it would get to a dangerous level (around 3), i checked again an hour later, it was at 2. I panicked again and called my mom(I'm 21) in sheer panic for advice. I was weak, nauseous and confused. And then, all of a sudden, it all went away and I felt almost normal again, it was like a switch from feeling sick to being normal in a blink of an eye. Checked the ketones: 0.4, and the CGM: 13.

I finally could breath out and the danger was over. Today(one day later), I feel anxious and down (Which i rarely do) because I realize how fast things can go wrong, and that this disease is so dangerous and cruel to us.

I was supposed to meet some friends today to play Golf, but i cancelled everything because of anxiety and general sadness. I just feel sad, alone, single and like shit. Maybe it is a natural response to this kind of event? I don't know. What would you do in my situation?

Are there maybe some plasters or patches I can use and if so, do you have some recommendations? I won't be going down like 10 meteres anyway, just some fun time at the beach.

I tried to give blood today and almost passed out after the finger prick, even though I have had blood drawn for tests several times, so I thought I would get through the whole process okay. Once the blood pressure cuff went on after the finger prick, the pressure dropped through the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

But my question is this: In trying to think what might have triggered the vasovagal response other than just first time nerves + the heat outside. And I have a memory that factors in. I recall being in school, about 7 years old, and learning about diabetes in the gymnasium. Some nurses were demonstrating blood sugar tests and I was handed a finger pricker. I didn't understand what it was and I held it out to the nurse who took it and right away drove it in. This would be around 1998, Oregon. And today was the first time I have had the finger prick since, 20 years later, and everything froze up just like it did then.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it even possible that this memory is accurate? It seems utterly bizarre now, feels like there's no way they would just hand a 7 year old kid the thing, even in the 90s, haha. But it might have been part of the demo, as I imagine that was something a diabetic kid would be able to do at that age. But I didn't absorb what that plastic thing was going to do before it was done. And now there is such a need for blood and I couldn't contribute, dang.

Blood Sugar Ultra Ingredients

([https://www.omegaprize.com/product-page/blood-sugar-ultra](https://www.omegaprize.com/product-page/blood-sugar-ultra))

&amp;#x200B;

**Vitamin C**

people with type 2 diabetes who took a vitamin C tablet two times a day reduced their blood glucose spikes after meals by 36% [(Source)](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2019/feb/vitamin-c-linked-to-reduced-glucose-levels-in-type-2-diabetes-95348957.html#:~:text=A%20small%20Australian%20study%2C%20published,spikes%20after%20meals%20by%2036%25)

**Vitamin E**  
findings indicate that vitamin E improves oxidative stress and hepatocellular function. Although insulin resistance also improves, this effect appears transient. [(Source)](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/9/2166)

**Biotin**

Biotin administered as an adjuvant in addition to insulin therapy can improve glycemic control, as well as serum lipids concentrations in type 1 diabetic patients without any side effects. [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679599/#:~:text=Another%20study%20showed%20that%20administration,oral%2Dglucose%2Dtolerance%20tests)

**Magnesium**

Hypomagnesemia occurs in 25-38% of patients with type 2 diabetes. Several studies have suggested an association between magnesium (Mg) depletion and insulin resistance and/or reduction of insulin secretion in these cases.  
Mg depletion is common in poorly controlled patients with type 2 diabetes, especially in those with neuropathy or coronary disease. More prolonged use of Mg in doses that are higher than usual is needed to establish its routine or selective administration in patients with type 2 diabetes to improve control or prevent chronic complications. [(Source)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9589224/)

**Zinc**  
analysis revealed that several key glycemic indicators are significantly reduced by zinc supplementation, particularly the FG in subjects with diabetes and in subjects who received an inorganic zinc supplement [(Source)](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/110/1/76/5510583?login=true)

**Manganese**

Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace metal with insufficient intake in virtually all diets. It has been reported that Mn is involved in normal immune functions, regulation of blood sugar and cellular energy, and the defense mechanisms against free radicals 

Blood manganese levels were significantly lower in the diabetes group compared with the non-diabetes group. [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3973834/)

**Banaba Leaf**  
growing body of evidence involving animal and human studies as well as in vitro systems indicates that Banaba leaf extracts exert antidiabetic and antiobesity effects [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3468018/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20various%20studies%20have,in%20mice%20compared%20with%20rats)

**Guggul**  
guggul formulation has a promising antidiabetic property and is effective in the treatment of diabetes. [(Source)](https://pharmascope.org/ijrps/article/view/1823/2774)

**Licorice Root Extract**  
liquorice root also contains substances with an anti-diabetic effect. These amorfrutins not only reduce blood sugar, they are also anti-inflammatory and are very well tolerated. [(Source)](https://www.mpg.de/5612351/amorfrutins_diabetes#:~:text=Researchers%20at%20the%20Max%20Planck,and%20are%20very%20well%20tolerated)

**Cinnamon Bark**  
Cinnamon bark extract improves glucose metabolism and lipid profile in the fructose [(Source)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16990960/)

**Gymnema Leaf**  
people with high blood sugar who took gymnema leaf extract for 90 days all had lower levels. Gymnema also appeared to increase glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. [(Source)](https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/gymnema-future-treatment#effectiveness)

**Cayenne Pepper**  
capsaicin has ability to control of metabolic syndrome and its related disorders such as obesity, disrupted lipid profile, diabetes and its complications. [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6000222/)

**Juniper Berries**  
Juniper berries are also a worthwhile addition to the diet for people at risk for heart disease, diabetes and cancer.

White Mulberry Leaf  
white mulberry seem to lower blood sugar in people who have type 2 diabetes [(Source)](https://draxe.com/nutrition/juniper-berries/)

**Vanadium**  
studies have shown that vanadyl sulfate can lower elevated blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides in a variety of diabetic models [(Source)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9823013/)

**Alpha Lipoic Acid**  
While most of the research on ALA in diabetes has focused on its effects on neuropathy, several clinical trials have now found ALA may increase insulin sensitivity and help reduce blood sugar and lipids, largely through improving measures of oxidative stress and inflammation. [(Source)](https://diabetesaction.org/article-alpha-lipoic-acid)

**L-Taurine**  
Taurine supplementation has been shown to suppress hyperglycemia and reduce plasma HbA1c, cholesterol, and triglycerides in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rats.

But I still have irregular symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, occasional blurry vision, and weeing a lot. 

So my doc isn't interested, although he was based on symptoms, and really on the phone before testing his only question was 'how bad and how long' not whether I had diabetes.

I also get really dry skin, and bad circulation after eating carbs ( blood pooling in my hands after eating ice cream for exemple). Also my hands go kind of numb after eating sugar. 

If I just eat proteins for a day or eat low gi food as while wheat etc I feel 10x better and all this sickness tends to disappear. It's like my body is allergic to carbs.

41," Type I diabetes is a common condition within the United States with something in the region of about one million sufferers and some 10,000 new cases being diagnosed each year. It is especially common in children and young adolescents, but is also often seen in adults in their late 30s or early 40s.

Type I diabetes is essentially an autoimmune disease in which the body's own immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas which produce insulin and production is either significantly reduced or eliminated altogether. Exactly what triggers this autoimmune response is unknown although it may well be triggered by some forms of viral infection. There are also various theories that it may be caused by the production of antibodies in response to the protein in cow's milk, a reaction to excessive levels of vitamin D or a reaction to certain drugs, including some antibiotics. At the end of the day, however, the true cause of type I diabetes remains a mystery.

The failure of the body to produce insulin results in a buildup of glucose within the blood and it is this which gives rise to a wide range of symptoms.

In many people the first signs of type I diabetes will be an inability to regulate water within the body which will be seen as excessive urination and thirst. At the same time, because the body is not able to take up the glucose that it needs from the blood to provide it with energy, the brain also triggers the need to eat and sufferers feel very hungry. Additional symptoms caused directly as a result of the failure of the body to receive the energy that it needs are a feeling of tiredness, as well as increasing nausea and blurred vision.

Diabetes is a very common and serious condition that millions of people are already dealing with today. Many more will develop the condition in the years to come and it is therefore one that all people should be informed on. The most important thing is to know what type diabetes you have if you do ever develop it.

Different Types Of Diabetes

There is not just one type diabetes and in fact a few, each with its own list of causes and symptoms. Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common type diabetes and was previously known an insulin-dependent diabetes. Type 1 diabetes most commonly develops in people under the age of 40. Each type diabetes works differently and with type 1 diabetes the body actually does not produce insulin at all.

Insulin therapy is used for this type of diabetes and once a person with type 1 diabetes has been able to find a successful treatment for their condition they can learn to live a healthy, happy life once again.

Another type diabetes and the one that is most commonly diagnosed is type 2 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes the body does produce insulin but what happens is that the cells in the body ignore the insulin. The body is resistant to the insulin and this results in the person not having a normal glucose level. This can be very dangerous, especially if the person is not eating the right amount of sugar because their blood sugar levels are going to be so out of whack.

My last 2 bloodworks (6 months apart) were fasting and on one my fasting glucose was 106 and on the other it was 100.

Essentially he wasn't worried and brushed me off and wouldn't order additional testing to see if I'm pre diabetic.

&gt;""That’s why today I’m going to be signing shortly an executive order promoting competition to lower price — to lower prices, to increase wages, and to take another critical step toward an economy that works for everybody....  
&gt;  
&gt;""Look at what that means for family budgets.  Take prescription drugs: Just a handful of companies control the market for many vital medicines, giving them leverage over everyone else to charge whatever they want.  As a result, Americans pay two and a half times more for prescription drugs than in any other leading country.  And nearly one in four Americans struggles to afford their medication....  
&gt;  
&gt;""First, the FDA — the Food and Drug Administration — are going to work with states and Tribes to safely import prescription drugs from Canada.  That’s just one of many actions in the executive order that will lower prescription drug prices.....""

FWIW, seemingly relevant excerpts from:

""[Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/)""

Section 1.  Policy.

Americans are paying too much for prescription drugs and healthcare services — far more than the prices paid in other countries.  Hospital consolidation has left many areas, particularly rural communities, with inadequate or more expensive healthcare options.  And too often, patent and other laws have been misused to inhibit or delay — for years and even decades — competition from generic drugs and biosimilars, denying Americans access to lower-cost drugs....

This order affirms that it is the policy of my Administration to enforce the antitrust laws to combat the excessive concentration of industry, the abuses of market power, and the harmful effects of monopoly and monopsony — especially as these issues arise in labor markets, agricultural markets, Internet platform industries, healthcare markets (including insurance, hospital, and prescription drug markets), repair markets, and United States markets directly affected by foreign cartel activity....

It is also the policy of my Administration to support aggressive legislative reforms that would lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and through other related reforms.  It is further the policy of my Administration to support the enactment of a public health insurance option....

Sec. 5.  Further Agency Responsibilities.

(h)  To address persistent and recurrent practices that inhibit competition, the Chair of the FTC, in the Chair’s discretion, is also encouraged to consider working with the rest of the Commission to exercise the FTC’s statutory rulemaking authority, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, in areas such as:

(iii)  unfair anticompetitive conduct or agreements in the prescription drug industries, such as agreements to delay the market entry of generic drugs or biosimilars;

 (p)  The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall: 

(iv)    not later than 45 days after the date of this order, submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Director of the Domestic Policy Council and to the Chair of the White House Competition Council, with a plan to continue the effort to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the Federal Government for such drugs, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging;

(v)     to lower the prices of and improve access to prescription drugs and biologics, continue to promote generic drug and biosimilar competition, as contemplated by the Drug Competition Action Plan of 2017 and Biosimilar Action Plan of 2018 of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including by:

(A)  continuing to clarify and improve the approval framework for generic drugs and biosimilars to make generic drug and biosimilar approval more transparent, efficient, and predictable, including improving and clarifying the standards for interchangeability of biological products;

(B)  as authorized by the Advancing Education on Biosimilars Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-8, 135 Stat. 254, 42 U.S.C. 263-1), supporting biosimilar product adoption by providing effective educational materials and communications to improve understanding of biosimilar and interchangeable products among healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers;

(C)  to facilitate the development and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable products, continuing to update the FDA’s biologics regulations to clarify existing requirements and procedures related to the review and submission of Biologics License Applications by advancing the “Biologics Regulation Modernization” rulemaking (RIN 0910-AI14); and

(D)  with the Chair of the FTC, identifying and addressing any efforts to impede generic drug and biosimilar competition, including but not limited to false, misleading, or otherwise deceptive statements about generic drug and biosimilar products and their safety or effectiveness;

(vi)    to help ensure that the patent system, while incentivizing innovation, does not also unjustifiably delay generic drug and biosimilar competition beyond that reasonably contemplated by applicable law, not later than 45 days after the date of this order, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, write a letter to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office enumerating and describing any relevant concerns of the FDA;

(vii)   to support the market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars, continue the implementation of the law widely known as the CREATES Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-94, 133 Stat. 3130), by:

(A)  promptly issuing Covered Product Authorizations (CPAs) to assist product developers with obtaining brand-drug samples; and

(B)  issuing guidance to provide additional information for industry about CPAs; and

(viii)  through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, prepare for Medicare and Medicaid coverage of interchangeable biological products, and for payment models to support increased utilization of generic drugs and biosimilars.

 (q)  To reduce the cost of covered products to the American consumer without imposing additional risk to public health and safety, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall work with States and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173, 117 Stat. 2066), and the FDA’s implementing regulations.

Note: dont do this without medical supervision, If ur going to do extended fasts take your electrolytes Dont even try to fast as a type 1 if you dont have a CGM &amp; and a pump, For context i measured my bloodsugar 40/day during this fast Sorry for my probably awful grammar If you have ideas for improving the style of documentation send them my way

My start weight was 95kg 1.82m resting glucose of about 110-100 basal insulin \~20-28 Units (depending on activity, 1Iu an hour and a bit more in the morning) 1Iu of insulin is worth 12g of crabs 1iu of insulin lowers BG by \~ 35, overall insulin use per day roughly 40-60 IUs multiple years of pretty consistent Gym exposure (3-4 years) and a roughly 5-year history of semi-consistent running

Pics/Proof: [http://imgur.com/gallery/8XStqlo](http://imgur.com/gallery/8XStqlo)

START &amp; DAY 1

I started the fast off with a big big meal (roughly 1.6k calories) in the evening (9pm) which caused my blood glucose to spike overnight to roughly 270 levels at their peak (didn't adequately adjust my bolus sadly) in the morning they were back down to 80-90 levels after adding some bolus.   
After roughly 9 am (10-12h from my last meal) it was a fight of constantly measuring and cutting down on my basal rate for most of the day between 9 am and 4 pm I played most with -20 - 40% cuts to basal insulin, after that, I started cutting it down more radical as my blood sugar never crossed above the 100 levels and were mostly at 80-90 which was a bit to low for my taste. So starting from 4 pm I made multiple 80-100% cuts to my insulin partly because I had to walk some minor distances to get back home from work and because I tried to get it back up which it just wouldn't do.   
Before I went to sleep I put my basal rate at - 55% so down to 0.45Ius per hour

On the first day I, all in all, I used 24.2 IUs on Insulin 19 Basal 5.2 Bolus no carbs walked 5k steps Mood: no hunger felt pretty good, definitely felt it when my glucose storages started to run dry after around 10-12hours into the fast

DAY 2

Starts at roughly 3:30 am where I woke up with a reading of 64, I ate an apple as the level wasn't dropping but just going flat at 60 and went back to bed. (didn't see any need for dextrose as BG was just flatlining)  
My blood sugar when waking up again (at 5:30 am) was at roughly 100,  I reduced my basal program by 50% (0.5IUs/h) and it went back down to 80 after 2 more hours I then created and introduced a new Basal regiment because the old one clearly wasn't working as intended which gave me 0.35IUs/hour and 0.5 in the morning hours equaling out to 8.75IUs/day. Also took a ketone test at 9:30 (36h from the last meal) because I was worried about the prospect of entering ketoacidosis despite staying in low BG levels.   
Ketones were at 0.5mmol/Liter so it seemed like I was entering ketosis. Measured again that evening to make sure it isn't ketoacidosis did another test at 12 because i did some light ""exercise"" and i was feeling a bit unwell, ketones were at 0.8 i turned off the -40% basal i had going (which put me at 0.21IUs/h) to increase utilization of existing BG (which by now was at 109) and started drinking quite a bit (1-1.4L of water) to filter out ketones through urination despite adding some additional insulin to my basal it didn't seem like my BG levels did want to drop for a couple of hours, (i was at 120 at the time, looking back it probably was a lack of usable energy in the body, caused by reducing my basal Insulin by so much - Once the insulin started working I felt way better tho)   
At 15:30 i reduced basal insulin by 100% for one hour as I was planning to go outside blood sugar shot up to 120 for 30 min as a result of that but went back down to 100-110 levels at 6:30 pm i reduced basal rate by on average 50% to go for a walk to get my steps in for the day, after the walk glucose levels were down to roughly 100-90 it seems like not too much BG was burned and the body is instead of burning up more fat. Lastly, blood Ketone levels were at 0.7mmol/L (48 hours after the last meal) going to bed with a Bloodglucose of 90 might reduce the basal rate a bit to not have a low blood sugar event again

Ketones: 0,5 early 0,8 midday 0,7 before bed 7.5k steps walked, feeling a lil bit foggy but that was most likely the lack of usable energy due to cells not being fat-adapted yet and not enough insulin being available to use BG.   
I needed roughly 12IUs of insulin to prevent feeling shit this could probably be reduced down to 10 morning weight: 94.2 - Mood: no hunger whatsoever only some gusto when i bought some food but i quickly stashed it away as to not fall to my temptations

DAY 3

BG levels throughout the night remained at roughly 80 no lows or highs, i reduced my basal rate by 25% for 2h because I thought they might be too low and i planned to go outside to buy some Potassium supplements (i wasn't really getting any aside from the stock cube i used for beverage for the past 2 days) took 4 pills (5.6kmg bit more than 1 daily dose of Potassium) at once to compensate for going without it the prior day's ketones 9 am were at 0.9mmol/L (60h after the last meal) and switching pods took me an hour due to pod complications so no insulin there.   
changed the pod location from belly to thigh so there might be absorption rate differences result in a minor peak potentially, it also stressed me out a bit cause now I gotta refund an omnipod .\_. (kinda my fault tho cause me stoopid) Went to the gym and worked out blood sugar spiked up to 155ish (probably because of increased cortisol&amp;Adrenalin being released causing glycogenesis, the delay in getting the pod to work &amp; it being on my thigh, potentially causing a slower absorption rate) and went back down after adding some insulin 1.3 Ius in total, and some cardio. Over the remainder of the day, it went down to 80 by the end of the experiment. I used some basal rate decreases by on average 25% for 2 hours in order to get my blood sugar to rise a bit for leaving work and going home, which worked out fine. The last Ketone reading was 0.7mmol/L

Morning weight 91.9Kg evening weight 92 Kg step-count: 11K Ketones: early: 0.9 - evening: Total Insulin use: 8.5IUs (if it would have followed the same pattern till 0 am): 9.6IUs, (Despite the spike because of working out, if i hadn't trained it would have probably been 8 IUs) Mood: Felt pretty weak and cold in the morning and at work but not really like I had less energy, but my fidgety nature was definitely suppressed No hunger pangs or anything the like

Conclusion: As expected my Ketones levels went up, but i didn't get any symptoms of Ketoacidosis so Im sure I wasn't  in one.   
My Insulin needs to be decreased and would probably decrease further if i continued if i had to guess from 10IUs down to 8 . I am planning on doing more fasts and longer ones. Also seeing how cardiovascular activity affects my blood sugar while being in ketosis will be very interesting

Further Plans: making a post about Ketosis&amp;Type 1, Fat adaption in Typ 1 &amp; results (they are legit awsome), how id go about fasting as a Type 1, documenting a longer fast and lastly documenting fat-adapted marathon training (currently held back by no having any ketone testing strips Dx or CGM)

I am a type one diabetic diagnosed a decade ago now. My glucose control has been average (A1C's of 7 to 8). However, recently I have been taking much better care of myself and following a strict low-carb diet. I've been seeing great results - and I believe that reminding myself of those short-term result is all the motivation that I need, and perhaps that's the case for you too.

Whenever doctors give diabetes-related advice they cite the horrible long-term complications and patients end up weighing their food decisions against such a long-term, distant risk that is easy to forget sometimes. But, I have found that there are many immediate benefits that are worth ""depriving"" your self from carbs for and I'm sure most of you have experienced them during your diabetes journey.

It certainly is more of a joy to feel good, energetic, and productive than to eat a cookie, deal with its blood glucose consequences, and regret it later. Diabetes is definitely less of a problem for me, requires much less attention, and causes far less swings now that I'm very careful about what I eat.

After this experience, I don't think I'll ever go back to my old ways of eating.

I check before and after each meal, since day 1, and my BG numbers have been fairly in check (between 75 mg/dL and 114 mg/dL). 

Or that's what I thought at least. 

**This is where I screwed up**:

I read the user manual of the Glucometer. On page 10 and 9, it reads:

&gt; Smart Code Key is designed to calibrate your meter to make each lot of strips have the same performance. Each new box of strips contains its new Smart Code Key. The Smart Code Key stores calibrated information that your meter needs to give you accurate blood glucose results. **You must change your Smart Code Key with each new box of GS300 Test Strips**

I haven't been doing that. I buy strips (which are compatible with the Glucometer), and I use them without changing the Smart Code Key, which calibrates the meter. 

Realizing the big fuckup, and reading that an uncalibrated meter can be off by up to 43%, I'm scared shitless that my BG has been high all this time without me realizing it because I'm a dumb ass.

I've only recently started monitoring my blood sugar levels, and I will be going to see a doctor and get blood tests in about 3 weeks. 

I've had a very big overhaul to my eating habits, but I still have had a few days where I eat a carb heavy meal to see how my blood sugar reacts. One of my earliest ones was brown rice and chicken with a sugary sauce. After 1 hour, I spiked to 161(which is the highest I've seen to this day), and dropped  to 142 2 hours after eating.

For the amount of sugar/carbs that I ate, if figured the numbers weren't horrible, though not optimal. However, when I woke up the next morning, 9 hours after eating, I was still at 108, which really concerned me. 

Just today, I did some testing again. I ate maybe 2-3 cups white rice, with some eggplants and blackbean sauce(don't know how sugary it is). These were my results:

1hr: 132
2hr: 140 (don't know why it took so long to spike)

5hr: 122

9,"Hi everyone so in September while I was still 16 I was staying in a psychiatric hospital and they noticed that my blood sugar was really high and it was obvious that something was going on. After doing some test it came back that I was diabetic but they didn’t know what type n they still don’t because after I was released my parents didn’t take me to the doctors:/

Fast forward to about two weeks ago I got sent to a behavioral clinic and ofc my blood sugar was high so the doctor there ran some test and put me on insulin which was scary for me but I’m good now. 

I don’t know why my father is the way he is, he tells me things like “you’re not diabetic”, “it’s all in your head”, “it’s not because it runs in the family” and whenever I start to feel sick like my blood sugar is low he doesn’t believe and thinks I’m only saying it because I want juice or something. It takes a toll on me sometimes because I feel like I can’t control my body or something and it frustrates me. Has anyone else dealt with this? How can I talk to him about it?

I use a medtronic cgm and lately I've been having issues with my 3rd party patches.  I use ""not another patch"" and they always worked fine.  Now after 4-5 days the edges curl up and catch my shirt as I remove it and pulls it all off.

For years I have suspected that my boyfriend may be diabetic. Everytime we bring it up to a doctor they dismiss it because as far as we know, it doesn't run in his family. 
So the first time this happened, he got nauseous, lost vision, was confused and shaky. It had him down for awhile but it ended with a fair paramedic that used coca cola, and a 'sugar Iv' (which we initially thought to be insulin but now have realized it may have been dextrose) to bring him out of just dire straights, it worked for a few days but he cut out soda and that's how it ended up lasting months.
After that, a few years later it happened again. When he went to the hospital his kidney function was all wonky. I did not go with him, I don't know what all happened that time.
Now, I am finding out that no testing for diabetes ever took place in 5+ hospital visits other than an A1C. He went to a doctor this time and the only thing that popped up out of ordinary ranges was his thyroid but they said his other ranges were fine so hyperthyroidism. Yet again, another A1C and won't do any other testing... 
I don't know what the heck to do, it's scary. He's dropped weight like crazy. He's a mess emotionally &amp; something just feels off to me that they literally won't run anything other than an A1C &amp; even though they said hyperthyroidism and now he's hitting a scary weight range (way below what he should be) they won't do anything for him because ""it's not dangerous"".

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Wanted to reach out here as I spoke with my clinical pharmacist a few minutes ago and he was baffled and I thought I'd give it a shot bringing the question here.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a 37m. I take Humalog, Lantus, Losartan, Hydrochlorothizide, Metformin, and Amlodipine. I am a non-smoker. I have T2 diabetes and was diagnosed 5+ years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; A week ago, Sunday, I noticed my levels going lower than normal, my average glucose as reported by my sensor would be in the 110-130 range in the evening when I slept but the Sunday before my sensor change, my blood glucose dropped down to 70-75 basically the entire night.
&gt; 
&gt; The next day, I changed my glucose sensor and saw the same thing. At night while sleeping, I generally drop down into the 70-80 range while asleep. During the day, my glucose levels rarely rise above 140. In addition, I have been taking far less rapid-acting insulin (some days, I was taking as little as 5-10u compared to the up-to-60u I'm prescribed) and began working with my doctor to cut back on long-acting insulin because I felt I was eating too much sugar to keep my blood sugars elevated.
&gt; 
&gt; Two nights ago, while asleep, my blood sugars dropped to VERY low levels, as in it appeared as if my glucose levels had tanked into the 40s-50s. Because of what I'd eaten the prior evening, there was no way this was accurate since I had also taken no rapid-acting insulin.
&gt; 
&gt; My AM scan on my sensor shortly after waking read 103 but a finger stick showed 145.
&gt; 
&gt; A little later in the afternoon, after lunch, my meter read 127 (with an upward trend) but my glucose stick was 205.
&gt; 
&gt; After calling Freestyle and explaining the situation, they advised I replace the sensor and they would send me a replacement.
&gt; 
&gt; I did replace the sensor and have been keeping an eye on my sugars since.
&gt; 
&gt; At first, I was hopeful it was just a sensor problem as I scanned a 139 on the sensor and a finger stick at the same time read 161. However, post dinner, there was a 50 mg/dl difference between between the sensor and the fingerstick, but since I had just put that sensor in, I wanted to give it time.
&gt; 
&gt; So today is when things get really bad.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking at the trend data from the evening, my interstitial glucose hovered in the 30-50 range all evening while I slept. Shortly after waking, this popped up to 135 on the CGM (which I guess can be expected if I'm laying on the sensor) and it held steady at 130 over the next 15-20 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; However, my finger stick showed a 182.
&gt; 
&gt; At 10 AM, which was about an hour after breakfast. My meter read 173 while a finger stick showed a 231.
&gt; 
&gt; i was a bit tired so I took a nap and ensured I was laying so that I wasn't compressing the sensor.
&gt; 
&gt; After waking, the sensor shows my interstitial glucose levels at 44 (and it rose to 51 15 minutes later) while my finger stick is showing 136.
&gt; 
&gt; At this point, I'm planning to give Freestyle a call again today and possibly replacing this sensor again. My clinical pharmacist mentioned that sometimes Aspirin and Vitamin C can cause issues with interstitial glucose levels, neither of which are a factor with me. Also, I asked about dehydration since it's been extra hot here and I haven't been consuming as much water as I'd like, but he told me that I would need to be pretty severely dehydrated (either way, I'm drinking a liquid IV right now in case their is something goofy with my electrolyte balance that's maybe affecting this)
&gt; 
&gt; Was wondering if anyone else has had this problem or seen this sort of problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a sample of my logbook from today: https://imgur.com/a/Nf2recu
&gt; It's been almost 24 hours since having this new sensor and the previous sensor had this problem as well as the sensor before may have started to show this problem (so maybe it's not the sensor at all?)
&gt; 
&gt; At this point, I talked with my clinical pharmacist and I'm planning to put in a new sensor in my other arm. I primarily put it into my right arm since I almost exclusively lay on my left side or back so I often have trouble getting accurate readings at night while sleeping. I put the sensors into the back of my arm based on the directions they provide but I move it a bit around the area they tell you to put it in to ensure I'm not putting it in the same spot every time.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help you can provide.

Anyone have any ideas of things I should try or do before replacing the sensor?

I had a blood test done during a physical two months ago that came back high and was diagnosed with pre-diabetes. I also had a slew of vitamin and mineral deficiencies that would effect my mood/energy/etc. Severely Vitamin D deficient, considerably low on protein and iron. As well as other things not as bad. So at the time I explained to my doctor and dietician I wanted to approach managing the pre-diabetes as sustainably as possible and wanted to try to fix the deficiencies and pre-diabetes with my diet as much as I could. Although I am on Metformin!  


I've lost 30 pounds since I started my wellness adventures and like I mentioned, I'm trying to approach everything as sustainably as possible. I have not used sugar free/substitutes for many foods. I still eat regular cookies, candy, drinks, etc. but I do so in moderation. I cut soda out of my diet completely but that was a personal choice. I still enjoy my cold brew with full sugar sweet cream but only once a week, if that. Same with any sort of sweets. And I make sure I have something to eat with it. 

I know the standard for after a meal number to be 140 or lower. But, is it normal or expected to see higher numbers between when you start eating and 2 hours later? For example, if I were to eat a higher carb meal and my blood sugar went to 150-160 at the hour mark but settle down to 130 at 2 hours. Is that reasonable or safe for that to happen? I'm not sure if that's how a body is normally suppose to react to a heavy carb meal. lol   


I want to be safe with this and not stress my body out, but also want to reasonably add things back into my diet so I can live sustainably. With the rigorous testing I found that a cupcake with frosting and a regular sized snickers bar don't increase my blood sugar past 140. But regular potato chips and white bread? Highest readings I've had since diagnosed! Even though I am eating within carb limits. This was how my body reacted when I was pregnant. I could eat ice cream with no problem at all, but struggled with breads.

A slice of multigrain toast with peanut butter with an egg for breakfast, a tiny serving of rice with vegetables and chicken for lunch, and strictly protein and vegetables (e.g. salmon with broccoli) for dinner, with nuts and berries as snacks in between meals. She’s still a little weak so her exercise consists of going for a walk after breakfast. Even though her diet has been consistent or the past couple weeks, her morning glucose continues to fluctuate vastly. She takes her medication every day and long acting insulin before bed each night. Is there something we’re missing? Is there some sneaky food or ingredient that takes such a hold on her glucose? She’s been extremely stressed about it, which I know doesn’t help her glucose.

21,"Hey,

So, a bit of background - my diabetes team....aren't great. I don't like even calling them my team because I *barely ever* hear from them - for example, I've had to leave them 5 voicemails and 3 emails this month until they eventually responded today.

Anyway, over the last few months I've started a low carb diet which has drastically improved my blood glucose. However, I'm not  quite where I want to be, and long story short I'm interested in switching from Levemir to Tresiba for my basal, and incorporating R insulin into my regimen. The Tresiba is because I don't feel like I'm getting a full 24 hour coverage from my Levemir, even when I split it, and the R insulin because I very slowly rise on a fairly high protein diet, and R insulin seems to match the peak of this perfectly.

Anyway, the nurse I just spoke to point blank refused to even entertain the idea of switching to these insulins. I'm not surprised she didn't go for the R insulin suggestion - my team don't seem to be familiar with R insulin and think it's a basal - but I'm really surprised she was so against Tresiba as I thought it was quite common. She kept saying I can't split it so I won't get full 24 hour coverage and I'm having awful morning spikes (not sure if it's dawn phenomenon or feet on the floor), even though the idea of Tresiba is that it covers up to 36 hours.

Does anybody have any similar experiences? If so, how did you tackle it? I'm not sure what to do now, because I came off the call with no real solution or action.",diabetes,My (UK) team won't consider changing my insulins,1625584617

I think it would be better for me to get my prescriptions from a privatised source, so I can buy my medicine whenever I need it. I am more than okay with paying for it at this point, I would rather pay than go along with some stupid rules that don't apply to me because I only order when I need it.

31,"Hey Guys,

I am a 28 yo male type 1 diabetic of 10 years.  

Three months ago, I started doing a very low-carb diet and got back to weightlifting. The first couple of weeks were all about being careful and adjusting my insulin doses (I only take Novorapid and Toujeo). Afterwards, my glucose control was very good. My A1C dropped from 7.0 to 5.7, had minimal BG fluctuations, and felt great. Since I began the diet, I never really experienced significant dawn phenomenon-related highs; in fact, some days I would wake up with a slight hypoglycemia. However, the past week was just terrible; every morning at around 5 am my blood glucose would shoot up from an average of 6 to an average of 11-12 (which takes a long time to stabilize!).

The funny thing is that haven't changed anything lifestyle-related for many weeks; my levels of stress, sleep, diet, and exercise have been very stable since I began the low-carb diet. In fact, I've lost a considerable amount of body fat and gained muscle since then, which should have resulted in an improvement in insulin sensitivity.

This is baffling me. I tried upping my basal dose the last couple of days but I'm not seeing the improvements I want.

Now I understand those people whose primary reason for adopting a pump is to deal with this effect.

I am extremely lost, overwhelmed and depressed. Pre-covid I always worked out diligently so I have no issues with losing weight. Currently I am experiencing severe anxiety because I do not know what is in store for me due to being diabetic. I hope people can give me info or answer some questions.

1. With my current condition does it mean I can never eat like other normal people again? Do I have to now avoid rice, and bread for the rest of my life. 

2. I heard that diabetes can go into remission. If I can achieve that with weight loss does that mean I can get off meds and eat normally or will my blood sugar just spike up again. Is remission temporary or with enough work can I achieve a permanent one?

3. Is insulin/ medication inevitable? I have a phobia of needles and would really like to avoid it. Even if I work hard enough to lower my blood sugar. As I grow old is it inevitable that I will eventually have to take medication?

My Veteran affairs endocrinologist does not want to prescribe me a mealtime insulin.  He wants to treat me with 20 units of daytime lantus insulin.  With my past experience with the Va , i don't know if there are just being cheap with issuing the humalog or is this the best treatment.  

I do get then insulin at no cost through the VA. I feel that maybe that's why they don't want to prescription it.  However this conflicts with what the private doctor says.

56,"Most of the guides I've found online for this have been wrong so I thought I'd share what actually works for me.  I've been a lifelong fan of Hass avocadoes and in the last few years have gotten my system down where I always have a perfectly ripe/soft avocado with the right taste and texture available to eat every day of the week with no brown spots to cut away.  I'll use numbers to get you to having one every day with grocery shopping once a week, but feel free to scale up/down as needed:

At the store (unless you're out of avocadoes and need a soft one for today) always buy hard avocadoes and preferably buy them loose VS the bags of 3-5 of them.  Once avocadoes start to soften they become vulnerable to pressure so that idiot before you who was squeezing them with vice grips will have browned and bruised the avocadoes that have already started to soften.  When they're hard they're protected from bruising.  I say to avoid the multi-packs since I seem to get a higher number of avocadoes that just never properly soften out of those.  Anyhow, buy 10-12 rock hard avocadoes.

At home lay the avocadoes on your counter.  Doesn't matter if they're touching or not or other fruits around or any of that nonsense, just don't stack them on top of each other.  Once or twice a day check in on your avocado collection and test each for softness.  If you're not good at this, you might cut them open at different softness levels, try a taste, and discover what softness level you prefer.  There are other guides online that can teach you the finer points of this, but it's a bit of an art.  Note that if you end up with brown/bruised avocadoes later, your test squeezes were too hard.  In time you'll get this down and get good at it.  Once you're satisfied you know what you're doing take the avocadoes that are the right softness and put each one in the fridge whole.

Once in the fridge the softening/rotting process will slow down dramatically and I've had avocadoes that have sat in the fridge for nearly two weeks that still came out decent.  I don't mind my avocadoes cold so will cut them up and eat them straight out of the fridge, but if you don't just let them sit out on the counter to return to room temperature for a bit before consuming.

On your next weekly trip to the grocery store, pick up another 7 avocadoes, or whatever number you need to give you a healthy buffer so you never run out.

66,"So, I recently switched to a pump, and I chose the Insulet Omnipod Dash, and I really having a pump, but the stupid PDM sucks. Here's the reasons why

# Battery

This thing has a 1300mAh battery, which for non-techy people, 1300mAh is terrible. A standard phone, for example, the iPhone 8, has an 1821mAh battery, and that's good enough for about 14 hours, so you could imagine 1300 mAh is pretty bad. IMO, the bare minimum that's useable is 1500mAh. And batteries degrade every time they charge, and after maybe only a year or 2 of charging, the battery may only last an hour.

# Interference

When you're setting up a new pod or giving yourself insulin, if there's any electronics nearby, it won't be able to communicate. It's like the PDM has a very weak bluetooth chip. It's really annoying.

# Glitches.

The PDM is stupidly glitchy. Just one I'll bring up here, one time, I was setting up a new pod, and it failed to communicate (because i had my 3ds nearby), so I moved my 3DS and hit retry, and the damn thing returned to the home screen and said ""discard the old pod"", I had to throw the pod out and setup a new one. What a waste of insulin.

# Conclusion

The PDM is honestly a piece of garbage, and the worst part? It's a rebranded cheap phone. It's a Nuu A1. A 90 dollar phone, so if this cheap phone can do everything on the pod, then why is it not just a phone app?

Stairs are hellish. I go to bed in pain, I wake up I pain, and I'm having to inject gallons of insulin. Falling over all the freaking time. Scrapes and cuts take __forever__ to heal.

Did some research and it sounds like the Eliquis is probably screwing with the healing process of the overworked muscles... But it seems to be getting worse. Now my joints are hurting, stairs are not only painful, but difficult to climb. All my muscles - not just the legs - take turns aching.

I hit the ER after discovering the ""foot drop"" on the advice of my doctor. A head CT, full spine MRI showed no problems. Only real unusual blood test was the indicator for muscle damage. And mild liver inflammation.🤬🤬🤬. Otherwise ""perfectly normal""

Yesterday I noticed my hair is falling out 🤬😭

This survey is about how diabetics around the world experience food ordering apps/websites. I am researching how this can be improved, to either build or improve an existing application.

Entries will be checked if a proxy server was used to participate, as such ip-addresses are flagged by the masses. If so, you will be removed from participation. All information is given prior before one would start the questionnaire. I am a postgraduate student at UCL (University College London. See the link to the survey below:

Considering the situation with Covid-19 – it is incredibly difficult to find suitable respondents face-to-face. I am therefore conducting an online survey instead and would really appreciate your help – as it is difficult to find respondents given the current circumstances.

Please do reach out to me in a PM if you would like to learn more or just chat with me about type-2 diabetes, as I would love to give something more in return as well! I have a vast amount of scholarly knowledge around the topic and could, in return, help out with inquiries you may have.

My sensors have started to come off so early! Like within 3-5 days of applying one. It’s getting so frustrating having this happen because my insurance is being ass about coverage. I’ve tried to get in contact with freestyle libre Canada so many times but the wait times are always over 45 minutes and I’m on the phone waiting for up to 2 hours. I’ve emailed before but it takes weeks for them to respond so at this point I just need some sort of solution for keeping the sensors ON! What do you guys use? I apply those sticky patches on top and they still peel off in like hours! I even put a piece of medical tape on top of that and that even started peeling away.

I give type-2 diabetics (but also type-1 diabetics) a chance to win one out of ten 25,- Amazon gift cards in exchange for participation in a short 5-10-minute online survey, which I believe would really benefit you in the long run. This survey is about how diabetics around the world experience food ordering apps/websites. I am researching how this can be improved, to either build or improve an existing application.  


All information is given prior before one would start the questionnaire. I am a postgraduate student at UCL (University College London), one of the most prestigious universities in Europe). See the link to the survey below:

Considering the situation with Covid-19 – it is incredibly difficult to find suitable respondents face-to-face. I am therefore conducting an online survey instead and would really appreciate your help – as it is difficult to find respondents given the current circumstances.  


Please do reach out to me in a PM if you would like to learn more or just chat with me about type-2 diabetes, as I would love to give something more in return as well! I have a vast amount of scholarly knowledge around the topic and could, in return, help out with inquiries you may have.

So I am male, 6ft 3inch and weigh around the 170lb mark, work out 5 times a week. About a year ago, I had my yearly physical and my A1C came back as 5.7, which was a shock since my BMI is low and I work out most days. I admit back then I would eat quite a bit of junk food. I also take lisinipril for high blood pressure, but a low dose of 10mg a day, and the blood pressure is under control and actually quite low.

Anyway after this I changed my diet and went lower carb, tried to aim for around 130 gram of carb a day and no junk carbs, I.e no M and Ms, no chips, no white rice, stopped eating apples, etc. Also started taking my blood sugar in the morning and night with a test strip, I am using the Walgreens True Metrix.

After 3 months retook the A1C and it came down to 4.9, which was great. I kept up the same diet, trying to get the carbs around 130 g a day, and checking my blood sugar in the morning and night, which was averaging out to around 90. So I thought I was doing well.

So this week had my yearly physical and my A1C is back to 5.7 again and my fasting glucose was 106. I could not believe it, as I took my blood sugar before the test and it was 90. So I asked to have a retest to confirm it as it would imply that the test strips I am using are not working properly, I understand they are +/- 15%, but I would assume over time it should average out.

Was wondering has this happened to anyone else where the A1C went to 5.7, then dropped to 4.9 and back to 5.7, even though I was eating a similar diet and the test strips I was doing morning and night seem to show everything was good?",diabetes,"Doing all the right things, but my A1C still high.",1625312916

Every day, in the United States, more than 2000 new cases of diabetes are diagnosed. Type II diabetes, the most prevalent form of diabetes worldwide, often shows few or even no symptoms!

After eating, food is broken down into what is known as glucose, a sugar carried by the blood to cells throughout the body. Using a hormone known as insulin, made in the pancreas, cells process glucose into energy. 

Because cells in the muscles, liver, and fat do not use insulin properly in the body of a person with type II diabetes, they have problems converting food into energy. Eventually, the pancreas cannot make enough insulin for the body's needs. The amount of glucose in the body increases, and the cells are starved of energy.

This starvation of the cells, paired with the high blood glucose level can damage nerves and blood vessels. This leads to complications such as kidney disease, nerve problems, blindness, and heart ailments.

There are a lot of factors that can help to attribute to diabetes cases - lifestyle, environment, heredity - and those who are at risk should be screened regularly to prevent diabetes. Those that are already diagnosed with diabetes should aim to keep their glucose level under control.

But how do you know if you have type II diabetes? After all, it has few symptoms, often no symptoms in some patients. However, if you notice an increased thirst or hunger, a change in weight, or blurred vision, getting tested for type II diabetes is necessary, as only your doctor will be able to help you find the treatment steps necessary to being able to manage your life with diabetes. 

Simple changes such as eating right, managing your weight, and keeping your blood sugar level under control may be enough. However, you doctor may prescribe diabetes-regulating medications to assist you in controlling your type II diabetes.

Diabetes is a serious ailment with extreme consequences if it isn't treated properly. But if you follow your doctor's advice and maintain both your lifestyle and blood sugar levels, you can help to prevent the more serious consequences from occurring.

Firat, I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird.  Second, please forgive me if this has been done a million times over.  I was just diagnosed with diabetes a week ago.

 The doctor thinks I'm type 2, but we're also confused on that.  (I am only about 9 pounds over weight.  Plus  I've been actively losing weight - I've lost 20 pounds this year - and hitting the gym regularly.)

I wanted to see what others think, and if I should pursue getting checked out or at least picking up a blood sugar reader. Just worried that if it is diabetes and I don't catch it, more damage will be done.

I've had issues with my GI for years but have been diagnosed with: IBS-C, pelvic floor dysfunction, slow intestinal motility, and intestinal neuropathic pain. I'm on a bit of meds (Linzess, Miralax, and Colace) + psych meds (Wellbutrin and Amptriplyne), so I'm unsure if my symptoms are from those or are they all symptoms of untaken care of diabetes.

It does run in my family (grandmother, both uncles). I am athletic and eat 99% low FODMAP/whole foods due to the neuropathic pain+IBS. Though before diagnosed (years ago), I did eat a lot and large portions of refined foods like spaghetti, bran flakes, wheat bread, etc. daily.

Symptoms (taken from online searches):

Cuts on feet/hands/legs are slow healing, and if they ever heal, they leave scars. Feet/hands are also cold a lot, and in the winter, they're practically frigid/numb.

Tired almost always, no matter how much I do or don't sleep.

Vision gets a little blurry when transitioning from dim to bright lights.

Always have dry mouth or constantly thirsty, like I'll drink till my stomach's full and still feel like I'm dehydrated.

Have to piss a ton. I don't count but it's definitely 10+ times a day.

Exhaustion to the point that I'll can fall asleep at any given time in the day, no matter how much I sleep.

Lower body weakness. (Thought it was MS a year ago because my brother has it, but found I'm in the clear).

They seem to be advocating for pump usage but A1C is not so different (0.6%), and the pump users were significantly more likely to have access to CGM than non pump users.

——-

Average A1C was 8.9% in 2017 and 8.6% I’m 2020. Higher in younger people.

https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/diabetes/70/Supplement_1/833-P/F1.large.jpg

——-

In this group of 21,821 people with T1D, 58% were insulin pump users and 42% were non-users. Average A1c levels among insulin pump user group were 8.5%, compared to non-users, who had an average A1c of 8.9%. Of insulin pump users, 4% reported severe hypoglycemia, compared to 10% of non-insulin pump users. Only 2% of insulin pump users reported DKA, compared to 8% of non-users.

——-

Methods: The analysis included 8,062 T1D adults (18 - 65 years) in the T1DX-QI database for whom electronic medical record data were available, with at least one completed clinic encounter July 2017 - February 2020.

Results: In this population (age range 18 to 65 years), **20% (N=1,609) of T1D adults had optimal glycemic management (A1c &lt;7.0%**, see Table). 

Worse glycemic management was associated with being Non-Hispanic Black, having public insurance, older age, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. 

CGM use with or without insulin pump use, but not pump use without CGM, were associated with better glycemic management.

—— 

Methods: Using the electronic health record (EHR), we incorporated six patient-level diabetes self-management metrics into the clinical workflow for visits. Patients were classified as “performing the habit” if they:

* checked glucose ≥4 times/day or used a continuous glucose monitor; 
* administered ≥3 insulin boluses/day; 
* used an insulin pump; 
* bolused insulin before meals; 
* reviewed data between visits; 
* and changed insulin doses between visits. 

We then calculated a total habit score.

Results: Of 1344 T1D patients seen in 2019, we excluded patients who were new onset (n=57), not on insulin (n=2); missing HbA1c (n=9); or missing documentation (n=64); leaving 1212. 

HbA1c was significantly lower for those who performed each habit compared with those who did not. For every one-unit increase in total habit score, we found a 0.7% (8 mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c overall with similar reductions by race and insurance.

I recommend a Ninja cup blender with a 24oz cup - mine has an auto-smoothie button 😁

About 2 cups frozen fruit of your choice, a scoop of frozen concentrated orange juice (no sugar added of course), a dash of salt, zero-calorie sweetener to taste (splenda is working great for me) and maybe equal part (1-2 cups) ice. I just add ice up to the max liquid line. Finally half milk, half water up to the top of the ice (adjust per your thickness preference).

Play around with the fruit - bananas help thicken strawberries and with practice you can create a convincing facsimile. I has been using 2 cuties, then a whole orange and it had too much of a grassy-flavor lol. The frozen orange juice makes the process painless!

98,"Long post ahead. Also, forgive me in advance, I'm not the best with numbers. Wasn't sure what flair to use here so let me know if it's wrong.

I'm 18, f, 5'5.5"" and 130 lbs, give or take a pound or two. Never been overweight. My grandmother is the only diabetic in my family I know of. Not sure if she's T1 or T2. 

So, a few months ago (March 2021), I caught covid. My dad came home sick, went to the doctor and was told it was pneumonia but due to the fact that the healthcare system in my country is garbage, we didn't know it was covid until a week later. I had started to *feel* sick a while after my dad but I wasn't displaying any physical symptoms and I was under a lot of stress + not sleeping well, so I chalked it up to that. Few days later I wake up feverish and throw up so I go to the doctor, where I get misdiagnosed and sent home. I did a test later that week and found out I was covid positive. 

A while after recovering, I start to realize that I spend way more time in bed than usual, and that if I left the house for even 2 hours to do nothing but drive out with my mom or go visit my grandma, I get tired. Additionally, there's this weird thing that used to happen to me whenever my eating habits were worse than usual. 

You see, I have a terrible relationship with food. I had an eating disorder a few years ago, and I guess starving myself did something to my brain because post-recovery, I became somewhat of a compulsive eater, and it was mostly junk. My main poisons were plantain chips, brown rice and peas, cornflakes, and crackers (Jamaican water crackers, just flour and salt) and cheese, and I'd also take to bread sometimes too (all high carb foods). Even before all this I kind of realized I had a problem and cut myself off sometimes so there'd be months or weeks where I went without chips or crackers because I've always been kinda concerned about eating myself sick. It was admittedly always more of me eating these things than abstinence periods.


Back to my main point, for years now, whenever my eating habits were ""bad"", I'd get this really weird feeling in my face after eating. It would kinda heat up, and then get real oily. Like, you could sit and watch as my face gradually became oiler over a period or seconds/minutes, right after eating. I could look closely in the mirror and see as my pores started to glisten. I'd have to either wash my face, brush my teeth, or drink an uncom amount of water to get it to stop, and it  kinda waned sometimes if my eating habits were better (more fruits and veggies, less carbs)  for a week or a few weeks.

I had begged my mother to take me to the doctor because obviously somethings wrong with that, and she always said she would but she never did. The only reason she even took me this time was because of the fact that covid is a novel virus and it has all sorts of complications. She'd read of it triggering diabetes in people so I guess this made her finally started to take me seriously.

I went to the doctor on and told her all my symptoms, and she did a finger prick test on me. I was fasting and it was 4.9 or thereabouts, I dont remember exactly except for that it was in the four range. She said she wanted to do a blood test to make sure everything was okay because she ""didn't like my symptoms"" and wanted to make sure that everything was alright, so I had an executive panel done on May 20, 2021, and it returned saying my A1C was 6.0%.

The day after I get the results, she calls me in to see her and explains to me that I'm not diabetic, and she thinks that some residual effects of me having covid was what cause my A1C to be that high. Even after hearing about my eating habits, she insists that it's still just covid. She puts me on a diet (not keto, just less carbs that I'd normally eat with more ""whole"" foods), says to exercise, tells me to by a glucometer and test after meals, and tells me that she wants to run more tests to get a better picture of what's going on.

A few days after that, I do an 2hr OGTT. Fasting bg was 3.3, actually lower than what it was supposed to be, and the 2hr postprandial was 6.1 (or 6.4, I don't remember exactly). They never took a 1hr blood sample from me, but from what I've seen on the internet, that was supposed to happen. I also did a few tests with my glucometer and my fasting blood sugars and 2 hour postprandials are always in range (between 5 point something and 6 point less-than-five). After I see her again for the ogtt results, she tells me that this confirms her theory that I'm not diabetic or pre-diabetic,  and it was just a temporary thing due to covid. She tells me to continue with my diet and to exercise more, and that I'll retest my A1C in September 2021 to see how it has changed, then sends me on my merry, reportedly non-diabetic way.

I have crippling health anxiety, and I always have, so her words were never of any significant comfort to me. I tried to cut out carbs as much as possible (not to the point of keto, my mom won't let me) even though my doctor insists that I can eat a 'normal' amount. For reference, breakfast for the past month has been 2 egg whites and 7-9 grams of cheddar with 3 grams of jalapeños in a lettuce wrap with lemon ginger tea (&gt;1 g carbs according to the package). Lunch is normally something green and leafy stir-fried in olive oil with a bit of garlic. I dont cook dinner, but its normally higher carb than my other meals.

 I've been drinking water like a maniac, and I cut out fruit (which is probably the hardest part of all this for me because it's mango season in my country and I LOVEEEEE mangoes but they're sooooo sugary 💔), and I've tried to get my heart rate up as much as possible. I exercise in the evenings and try to fit a fifteen minute (at least) walk in after a meal as often as I can. I haven't really been doing that lately because I have exams, but I'm still trying to eat low-ish carb with more protein and green veggies.

I dont really test on my glucometer regularly, I mostly try to do it in the mornings to see my fasting bg, and 2hrs after meals to make sure everything is in order. However, sometimes after more carb heavy meals, I do a random test an hour or less after the meal. Obviously that's when the numbers are highest, but they're really high compared to what I'm used to. I've seen 10.7 after a bowl of Fava bean soup with a bit of baby corn. Today I saw 11.1 after a meal of bammy (20 something grams of carbs) and brown-stewed fish (also contains significant carbs but also a good amount of protein which should lower spikes, I assume). 

I know that these tests are catching my peaks, my bg always goes back down to the six range by the 2 hour mark. I know both of those meals contain significant carbs, but I've read some case studies off nondiabetics who wore cgms and their peaks were never that high, even after eating raw sugar. 

I kept panic testing after that and the results gradually went down to 7.7 half an hour after the 11.1 reading, and 6.5 an hour after that. 

So now I'm confused. Because I don't know what to think or what to believe. Ive been lurking in this sub for a month (to the day), so I know none of you are doctors but I also value personal experience and you guys have a lot of that. 

Why are my peaks so high? Is it  because of the carb loads in those single meals compared to my other low carb meals? Is this an early sign of a delayed first phase insulin response? Could it be an error on the glucometer? I always wash my hands and let them air dry before I test.

Am I just a hypochondriac? Can I pass an OGTT and still have problems using insulin? Should I listen to my doctor when she says it's only covid? I didn't want to take it for granted considering that 6.0% is in the pre-diabetic range and pre-diabetic is, realistic speaking, just type 2 caught earlier. 

What should I do??? 


Last point. I know that diabetes isn't a death sentence, and that with proper control it can be managed. My grandmother is proof of that to me, and lurking on this sub has confirmed it even more. But my parents have been very unsupportive during all this even though my anxiety has been at an all time high. They mock me for taking this seriously and have gotten angry at me for changing my diet. They very first day the doctor called, my mother was angry at me for my eating habits. I take full responsibility for getting myself into this situation due to mindless eating, but its still quite depressing to me to keep being reminded of it. At the same time, my mother has a co-worker/friend who's daughter is my age and has recently got diagnosed and she's seen the struggles that they've had to go through with her. I'm preparing to leave the country for university at the end of this year and she's told me that if I'm sick, she won't let me go.

Metformin, Jardiance, Actos, all have done basically nothing. I’m maxed out of Glimepiride now. 

The Glimepiride has been the first small positive step forward. But it rarely pulls me down under 100 and it’s very inconsistent when it works. I’m moving endos bc my current one basically says your numbers are in range. You are fine. Negative for Antibodies but c peptide has gone from 0.9 to 0.6 over about 4 months. Keeps getting harder and harder to keep my baseline down and spikes are getting higher with less carbs. Ie I’ll get close to 200 with 10-15g of carbs. When the glimiperide works it pulls my BG down in about an hour and half to two hours. If it doesn’t work, I just linger in the 140-150 range. 

I’ve been pushing for insulin for 4-5 months and they won’t do it due to the hypoglycemic risk and the fact my numbers are “in range.” How do I argue for this with the new Endo (or something else to pull my baseline lower)?

Also if I really was “fine and in range” shouldn’t this much Glimepiride make me go hypoglycemic also?

And now it looks like the same damn thing is happening to me.  I was officially diagnosed with diabetes last Oct when my A1C came back at 7.5.  My doctor had told me I was borderline for the last few years and I tried to make changes in my diet, but I wasn't agressive enough.  I used to be a 1-2 cans of soda guy with a heavy carb processed food diet.  I kept a watch on my sugars and they weren't that bad. 150 max after eating.

Unfortunately when covid 19 hit, I gave into a lot of pleasure eating and gained 10 lbs.  I stopped checking my sugar until last summer.  I knew I was in trouble when my sugars were as high as 220 when waking up.  My doctor put me on 45 mg of pioglitazone.  I was pleased when my 6 month followup A1c was 6.2.  My morning sugars were down to 125.  Not great, but definitely better. 

The celebration was short lived though.  In May, I woke up with all sensation gone in two of my middle toes.  After walking around, they came back.  But then I started getting burning sensations in both feets.  The numb toes kept happening more frequently.  I became worried I might have  blood clot in my leg as my calf would swell up too.  My doc ordered an ultrasound and the blood flow checked out good.  

Now my condition has quickly progressed to where I'm feeling numbness all day with all my small toes along with more burning sensations.  I'm seeing a foot doctor next week, terrified that my future will be like my friend, endless foot pain torture. Is it really possible to have nerve damage this quickly from diabetes?

May not be the best place to ask but can’t find much info anywhere.  I’m not a diabetic, never been risk for it (I think?), BMI 18 so on the skinny side.

Over the last month I’ve had 3-4 episodes of what I now understand is pretty bad hypoglycemia.  The first time it happened I remember feeling suddenly unwell, walking outside to get some air, being confused that my garden felt bigger and different and as I got more and more dissy and confused I laid down flat on the concrete and stared up into the sky where all sorts of things started to float together; clouds, thoughts, body, everything.  I was so confused I probably wouldn’t be able to say my name if you asked me.  I live alone so what could have happened kindof bothers me, but somehow something told me I need sugar.  I don’t remember getting up but was just on the couch later and feeling better, seemingly having licked on a Smuckers jelly jar.  Time past between was somewhere about an hour, (deciphered from seing text messages received/replied).

I felt shaky for the rest of the day and thinking about it I realized I hadn’t eaten much.  But that is not ‘abornal’ for me - I don’t get ‘hangry’, can go very long periods without eating and feeling perfectly fine, and can literally survive a day on like a pack of gummy bears with no problem (for the record, I don’t.  And I don’t have an eating disorder).  

Then same thing happened again a couple of more times, analyzing it I see it was usually around 3-4hrs after eating something sugary-ish.  The third time I was driving and nearly drove off the road- somehow I found my way to a McDonalds drive-through but don’t remember how I got there.  

So, being curious (and worried) I bought a Contour glucose meter thinking I would check if it was really food related or if there was something else going on in my brain.  I measured in the mornings, noticing I often wake up around 60mg/dl, even after eating properly before going to bed.  Otherwise it seems fine.  I don’t feel much of a differentce if its reads 95 vs 65.  I’ve never seen it above 130 even right after eating.

Skip to last night when sitting on the computer - doing literally nothing but sitting on a chair for hours - I recognize the feeling.  From the first tingly body sensation to the start of mental confusion in less than to minutes.  I go to the kitchen, having no real sugary food there at hand and in a panic stick a spoon into a box of pure cane sugar to eat..  Then I sit down and shakily prick my finger - 34mg/dl.  This was within first five minutes of an episode and I was still functioning, so I’m assuming the other episodes that went on for longer must have been way under 30.

I made myself some real food, tested again in 15mins and it was back over 80.  Then fine.

What is going on here?  It is obviously bad glucose regulation in my body but my diet is not bad and I am not starving myself.  I am not low carb or on any diet/vegan/vegetarian restrictions.  Mostly fresh and whole foods, try to avoid processed food but love the occasiobal donut.  Not drinking alcohol often and havent done any heavy excercise to cause glucose drops.

I have never had high blood glucose levels measured and get labwork about once a year -  nothing has been flagged.

57,"Hello everyone. New to this community.

Long post ahead, sorry. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. Lots of info to convey.

I was diagnosed as being prediabetic back around 2016. My A1c is really good now, 4.8%, but I am still having problems with insulin insensitivity.

I have been on some GLP-1 agonist or another since right about the time I was diagnosed. Metformin causes intolerable gastrointestinal side effects so my general practitioner at the time put me on Victoza. I had some weight loss, as GLP-1 agonists are touted to cause. After a few years, I got tired of the daily injections, so he switched me to Trulicity, and eventually took me off because my A1c was normal (5.0% at the time). Then my A1c crept back up slowly to the prediabetes numbers again, and by that time Ozempic had come out, so I was put on Ozempic. Shortly thereafter, I was referred to an endocrinologist, mainly because of my thyroid. He added Farxiga to the Ozempic because he said it would improve weight loss.

That was about October of last year, and I've managed to lost about 15-20 lb since then, but it's not budging anymore despite diet and increasing physical activity (not by much, admittedly, but I'm trying to work my way up). I'm currently 245 lb as of this morning. I have been wanting to do something about my weight for a long time now, but have recently got the motivation to really do something. I'm trying to do keto again, because several years ago I had a lot of success with it and lost 50 lb and nearly got down to my goal weight. It has been the only diet to ever help with weight loss (I realize it's not about ""dieting"" but about long-term lifestyle changes, but I intend to gradually go back to a more sustainable way of eating once I lose the weight).

Last appointment (a few weeks ago) was when he told me my A1c was 4.8%, which is the lowest it has been to my knowledge. He kept me on Ozempic 1 mg/wk + Farxiga 10 mg, and added metformin ER for insulin sensitivity. He said to start at 500 mg and increase slowly to 2,000 mg, keeping a close eye on my blood sugar for hypoglycemia. My insulin has been very high, as expected with the Ozempic. My endocrinologist also told me to kind of back off from the keto diet because Farxiga causes increased uptake of ketone bodies, which can lead to dangerously increased levels of ketones and hypoglycemia (ketoacidosis).

I'm wondering just how much Ozempic is actually impeding weight loss and if it may possibly be contributing more to insulin insensitivity by increasing insulin secretion (in a glucose-dependent manner). Increased insulin levels causes the body to go into storage mode, causing it to store fat more than it burns it (to my understanding). Insulin insensitivity is also caused by ever-increasing insulin levels and the body subsequently becoming less sensitive to it over time.

Is there something to this, or am I wrong? The key takeaways are that Ozempic has never helped me lose weight. Farxiga may have been the main reason I lost weight since October, but isn't helping much more, and is potentially making the keto diet dangerous to follow. I was put on metformin recently to improve insulin sensitivity and help with weight loss even more.

Not to be dismissive but I  did not expect it to be this damn depressing. It's so sad to see how many of you all are struggling through this without insurance and how much everything has been hiked over the years.

My dad lost his job during the pandemic and no longer has insurance. We bought some test strips and insulin in Mexico from my uncle who owns a pharmacy and I was astonished at how much different the prices are. I asked my uncle for safety data sheets and other documents from the Mexican pharmacy and they seemed to be almost exactly the same standards as the US. 

I originally wanted to sell insulin but found out it was a big no no with the FDA and decided to sell testing strips instead.

I will get all the major name brands freestyle, contour next, one touch,Accu check etc. I am not trying to price gauge anyone more than this market already has.

I would personally pick them up from my uncle in Mexico and store them appropriately and keep them in the right temperature. I will provide fast shipping and will adjust according to this subs constructive criticism. The expiration date will also be 12 months +.

77,"First started noticing diabetes symptoms in early-March (extreme thirst and having to pee like crazy after pizza or pasta as well as blurry vision).  Didn't really put together the seriousness of everything at first and figured I'd try to eat a little better and deal with what this meant at my next annual check-up (which I couldn't get into until the 2nd week of June.

Late-May did more research and after a few more episodes of extreme thirst and having to pee like crazy picked up a blood glucose meter on a whim the evening of June 4th (Friday) and tried it out right before bed.  First reading was ""HI"" and second reading was just under 600, even thought I hadn't eaten in hours.  That struck me as a bad result, but figured my thirst/urination symptoms weren't as bad as they'd been other nights so waited until Monday to go into urgent care, but from that point on my diet has been really tight with the exception of allowing myself 2-3 servings of fruit/berries a day.

A1C came back at 13.7 when I went in on June 7th.  Urgent care doc wasn't really proficient in diabetes, but after some consulting offered me insulin and metformin, of which I took the metformin with the plan to follow up with my regular doctor in a week (since that was when my annual check-up was already scheduled).

That week my blood sugar stayed in the 300 to 450 range pretty consistently day to day.  When I saw my regular doctor on June 14th I asked for a referral to an endo and to see if she would prescribe an SGLT2 inhibitor in the meantime.  Figure my kidneys had been rockstars already, keeping me alive, not to mention the 25 pounds of weight I'd lost in the last few months, and since my BMI was still around 27, why not let them pee out a few more pounds for now.

Within a couple days of starting Farxiga my blood sugar had dropped to the 100 to 160 range, which was encouraging.  That weekend I also added fasting to my regimen of daily walks and very low carb (with the exception of some fruit) diet and didn't eat from Friday after dinner until lunch-time on Sunday.  That finally got my blood sugar to land below 100.  Also, I was wrong about weight loss, which pretty much plateaued from there on out.

The week of June 21st I skipped some meals, maintained my diet, and generally my blood sugar would drop to 80-90 before meals and my morning fasting blood sugar was typically around 110.  Was testing the water of 8/16 intermittent fasting.

As I type this, I'm in the week of June 28th.  With my blood sugar levels being so low from where I started I decided to try going without Farxiga (sticking with the metformin since I suspect I'll want to take that long-term for general health reasons) and skipped my morning pill the 28th and the 29th.  My blood sugar levels have increased a little bit, but not enough to be a cause for concern.  After lunch spiked me to 175 today (prior days had been 130 to 150 spike) I was down to 74 when I checked it 4 hours later.

Is it reasonable that in less than a month I've went from typical blood sugar levels of 300-450 to 75-120 being my typical range with less than 5 pounds of additional weight loss during that period?  I've been eating 1500-2000 calories a day on average, mostly fat and protein and haven't been starving myself at all, just enforcing meals and mealtime.  Curiously, aside from being a downer to know my pancreas isn't healthy and I can't go back to my old way of eating, I feel the best I've felt and weight less than I have in 20 years (I'm a mid-40s male).

I haven't had a c-peptide or antibody test yet (will get those with endo), but assuming T2 for now since my fasting blood sugar was high last year at annual check-up, my BMI had crept up a little over 30, and my weight loss grinding to a halt seems to suggest there must be some insulin flowing through my veins.

I know everyone has a different experience, but this feels too good to be true and I'm kind of skeptical of it.  Is it reasonable to go from uncontrolled diabetes with an A1C of 13.7 to maintaining such good blood sugar levels in three weeks time?!  Or does an SGLT2 inhibitor stick around in your body for several days where I'm technically still on it and I'll be in for an unpleasant surprise later this week?",diabetes,"New diabetic, is it reasonable to see such dramatic progress in three weeks?",1625019041

I relayed the advice to him and he's been doing ok so far. 

Here is his BG readings from the day he was discharged from the hospital up until this morning: https://i.imgur.com/9uyG7en.png

As you can see, save for the few days after he was first discharged, ever since his BG was between 70 and 114. 

However, yesterday around 3 PM, he had a meal that he was unaware had around 30 g of carbs. His BG shot up to 170 mg/dL within two hours, then came down back to the 70-114 range around 3 hours after his meal. That was scary to him as he hasn't seen similar numbers in almost a month. 

The questions he had for me were as follows:

* Is it ok if his BG goes up to 170 mg/dL within two or three hours post meal and come back down below 100? 

* Would those post meal spikes (that last two to three hours) lead to complications short/long term?

* His BMI through the last month is within normal weight range. Prior to being diagnosed, he was Obese by BMI numbers even though he wasn't obese from his looks. He only realized this now when he started reading up on BMI (He was 5.7 ft tall &amp; 191 pounds weight, now the weight came down to 158 pounds). Is this a good thing for a diabetic?

Generally he feels fine, but his feet still feel heavy from time to time and he gets pins beneath them occasionally. It's been a month since he's got his BG in check, yet the feet pain/pins is still there. Has he developed irreversible complications?

Again, thank you so much for your patience, your advice and all the information you've provided us so far. Browsing this subreddit has been immensely helpful in knowing how to help him adjust to this.",diabetes,[Update 2] My T1D cousin has more questions.,1624979239

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24 years old, slim and otherwise healthy, i've always done periodic blood tests showing normal fasting blood sugars (altough usually in the 90's) and also glucose tolerance tests which have been normal until this past February, I travelled to another country and started eating terribly bad (soda which I never drink in industrial quantities, fruit juices, subways, rice, etc....) until after a couple of days when I started urinating frequently about every 30 minutes and had an unquenchable thirst, I thought this was odd at first and suspected diabetes but otherwise I had no other symptoms, this lasted for 2 days where I continued eating terribly with candy and soda in industrial quantities until I returned to my country, as soon as I got off the plane I got a blood sugar monitor which showed 435 mg/dl 2 hours after eating candy and coconut water in big quantities, I repeated the test 5 minutes later and then got 417 mg/dl, I started freaking out and decided to wait for an hour to see if it would go down, I waited 1 hour more and it had only got down to about 335 mg/dl so I went to the hospital where the hyperglycemia was confirmed by their own blood tests as somewhere around 350 mg/dl and I had a very small amount of ketones in my urine, my potassium and electrolytes were also a tiny bit off range because of the excessive urination and poor nutrition but nothing to serious, I was kept in observation for some hours where the glucose failed to fall into normal ranges only decreasing slighlty after 2 or 3 hours so I was given intramuscular insulin with instructions to go to the doctor, I went to an endocrinologist the next day who told me that maybe it could be Type 1 diabetes and gave me instructions to take Humalog Mix and to do an A1C test, the result of the test was 8.5, if I recall correctly he told me to take 10 ius per day 6 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon to start off the bat, in the following days I changed to a low carb diet and started with the Humalog but I had to keep reducing the dosages to the point where even 1 iu of Humalog would cause me to go to 55 or 60 mg/dl of blood sugar after a meal so the doctor ordered to suspend the Humalog and to continue with diet and exercise and that maybe I didn't have type 1, for several months I have controlled myself with diet and exercise and have kept myself under 100 mg/dl  fasting and under 140 mg/dl 2 hours after meals 95% of the time with diet and exercise, however this past week I have been in Turkey and my diet has been terrible eating only popcorn and potato chips this past week, even then, my blood sugars kept themselves in range at 140-150 mg/dl 2 or 3 hours after eating even after 100 or more grams of carbs from potatoes and popcorn, however, yesterday I ate a lot of meat with rice and potatoes (approximately 100 grams of carbohydrates) and my blood sugar spiked to 170 mg/dl at 2 hours and to 195 mg/dl 3:30 hours after eating and it took it almost 13 or 14 hours to fall back down to below 100 mg/dl which made me really scared, I know this is my fault for being complacent but i'm afraid to eat now at all and having it spike again, the worst part of this is not knowing what type of diabetes I have had COVID symptoms shortly before the onset of the symptoms and my doctor told me it could be temporary and that they have seen it before in other people however other doctors have told me it could be type 1 or type 1.5.... the reason i'm writing this is because i'm really afraid that I might have caused permanent damage with the 435 mg/dl at diagnosis and with the 8.5 A1C at diagnosis, I can't stop thinking about the damage I could have done and i'm really scared to think I might have caused permanent damage... I am just ranting now at this point but the idea behind posting this was to get to hear from you guys, i'd like to know if for other Type 1 diabetics this sounds like a typical Type 1 diagnosis and also if it's possible that those blood sugar numbers have caused permanent damage even as a 1 off event.

24,"And it was entirely my fault. I was diagnosed at 16 in 2018. For the first year and a half, my control was pretty good. It wasn't until late 2019 when I slowly stopped caring. Maybe it was the fact that I waned off my honeymoon period, maybe it was the fact that I spiraled further into depression, maybe I just got lazy. I don't know, but all I know is for the past 6 months I've basically lived with the mindset that I didn't have diabetes. I bolused sometimes, and when I did I would guesstimate it. The Dexcom hurts me now (no matter where I put it and trust me I've tried every spot) and I dislike finger pricking so I'd probably check my blood sugar once a week at most. 

High blood sugar was when I felt normal. I certainly didn't feel great, I'd pee 50 times a night, I'd wake up feeling like shit, but I didn't care. I felt sorry for myself, and I knew that it would eventually catch up to me but I didn't really care. I've just been in a really bad headspace for like the past year, and Diabetes was just something I didn't want to deal with, so I didn't deal with it. 

Fast forward to last night. I ate Chinese food and completely forgot to bolus. Now I usually will still bolus for meals, even if I just guesstimate, but this time I just completely forgot to do it. I woke up 50 times to use the bathroom, which was a normal thing for me, but this time I felt so dizzy that I couldn't stand for too long. I didn't think much about it, since I just thought it had to do with my high blood sugar. This morning, I got ready for work. I felt off and decided to check my blood sugar. It was at 350, which to me signified nothing. I probably reach 400 on the daily and still feel fine, so to me 350 was pretty normal. I bolus correctly and drive to work, and everything feels fine, except for some dizziness which I couldn't explain at the time. I get there and spend about 20 minutes there before it hits me. I felt so nauseous and dizzy that I couldn't stand. I've never felt like this before, so I was completely caught off guard. It was at this point that I remembered I forgot to bolus, and I pretty much knew right away this had to be DKA. This was my second week at my job, and they didn't even know I was a T1D, so I had to awkwardly explain to them that I had to leave. They let me leave and I start heading for my car and it starts getting so much worse. I feel so bad that I don't feel safe to drive. I had to have my mom pick me up. I go home and pee on the test strips and it turns a color so dark it wasn't even on the chart. That's when I know I have to go to the hospital.

I went to the emergency room. They took about 8 vials of blood, gave me 3 liters of saline, and probably a total of 12 units insulin, on top of the 10 I took this morning. I felt so terrible. I was dry heaving but luckily didn't puke, and that was partially because my stomach was empty since I didn't eat since last night. I spent about 6 hours total there, and luckily they only told me it was mild DKA, so I'm back home now. But I can't stop thinking about how I did this to myself. I'm still nauseous and dizzy and feel like shit, but I do feel better than I did before. I really want this to be my wake up call to start taking shit seriously. I'm not gonna get anywhere feeling bad about myself and thinking I don't need to take care of it.

I immediately went into research mode and found SO much conflicting info. Gag. One thing was obvious, cut out the junk. DONE.

They propose a high carb (tons of fruits and veggies) and low protein and fat diet.

Fortunately I don’t have low glucose levels that often, but when I do they’re pretty bad. Sometimes it takes about 30 minutes before it goes back to normal. It’s always tempting to grab candy to get it back up. 

Unfortunately I gained a little bit of weight during the pandemic. I know I should exercise a bit more but I also think it doesn’t help that I eat quite a lot of unhealthy stuff to get my glucose back up. 

I also feel like I need to take a lot. The other day I drank 750 ml of orange juice it wasn’t enough. This was on a warm, humid day and I had a busy day at work. I didn’t use insulin recently except my base of course.

I just ate a banana, 2 squares of 85% chocolate and a glass of milk within a span of 20 minutes. Before I aid, my BG was 4.7 mmol/L and I had been pseudofasting for 20 hours (had a latte with no sugar and 2 cups of green tea in that interval). 30-45 minutes after eating, it was up to 8.8-9 mmol/L and refusing to drop (throughout 30 minutes of testing).

Study shows, a normal metabolic profile does not mean that a person with obesity is actually healthy, since they face an increased risk of diabetes, heart diseases, strokes, an

Washington: A new study has found that having a normal metabolic profile does not mean that a person with obesity is actually healthy (referred to as metabolically healthy obesity), since they face an increased risk of diabetes, heart diseases, strokes, and respiratory diseases. The findings of the study were published in 'Diabetologia', the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). The research was conducted by Dr Frederick Ho and colleagues at the Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. They examined whether individuals who had obesity and a normal metabolic profile are healthy, or if they too have a higher risk of developing obesity-related health issues.

It is estimated that globally there are over 300 million people with obesity, and if current trends continue then this figure will likely exceed 1 billion people by 2030 and comprise 20 per cent of the world's adult population. The ongoing global epidemics of type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and many other serious health problems are linked with obesity.

Obesity typically leads to metabolic problems, characterised by elevated blood sugar, increased blood pressure (BP), insulin resistance, and other adverse metabolic changes. These effects are not universal, and some people with obesity have normal blood pressure, favourable blood fats, little or no systemic inflammation, and a healthy level of insulin. This is sometimes referred to as having 'metabolically healthy obesity' (MHO), and its occurrence is estimated to be 3 per cent to 22 per cent in the whole general population. This study looked at the association between MHO and all-cause mortality, T2D, heart attack and stroke, heart failure (HF) and respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MHO was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or above as well as meeting at least four of the six metabolically healthy criteria. These include blood pressure and 5 blood-based biomarkers: C-reactive protein (CRP, a marker of inflammation), triglycerides (fats), low-density lipoprotein (LDL/'bad' cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL/'good' cholesterol), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c, a measure of average blood glucose over the previous 2-3 months). Based on metabolic and obesity status, participants were categorised as: metabolically healthy non-obese (MHN), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy non-obese (MUN), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO).

The authors analysed the details of 381,363 individuals (excluding those classed as 'underweight') for a median follow-up period of 11.2 years. They were part of the UK Biobank project: a large-scale prospective cohort study that recruited participants from the general population across England, Scotland, and Wales between 2007 and 2010. The authors found that MHO individuals were generally younger, watched less television, exercised more, had higher education level, lower deprivation index, higher red and processed meat intake, and were less likely to be male and non-white than participants who were MUO.

Compared to metabolically healthy participants without obesity (MHN), participants with MHO were 4.3 times more likely to have T2D, 18 per cent more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke, had a 76 per cent higher risk of heart failure, were 28 per cent more likely to suffer respiratory disease and 19 per cent more likely to suffer COPD. Compared to metabolically unhealthy people without obesity (MUN), those classed as MHO were 28 per cent more likely to have heart failure.

The authors said, ""Generally, rates of cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes were highest in MUO, followed by MUN and MHO, except for incident and fatal heart failure, and incident respiratory diseases. For these outcomes, people with MHO had higher rates than those with MUN.""

They added, ""People with metabolically healthy obesity were at a substantially higher risk of diabetes, heart attack and stroke, heart failure, respiratory diseases, and all-cause mortality compared with people who were not obese and with a healthy metabolic profile. Particularly worth noting is that people with metabolically healthy obesity had a higher risk of heart failure and respiratory disease than metabolically unhealthy participants without obesity.""

Furthermore, the team also found that, amongst a subset of participants with follow-up metabolic and obesity data, one-third of those with metabolically healthy obesity at the beginning of the study period became metabolically unhealthy within 3 to 5 years.

The researchers concluded, ""People with metabolically healthy obesity are not 'healthy' as they are at higher risk of heart attack and stroke, heart failure, and respiratory diseases compared with people without obesity who have a normal metabolic profile.""

They advised, ""Weight management could be beneficial to all people with obesity irrespective of their metabolic profile. The term 'metabolically healthy obesity' should be avoided in clinical medicine as it is misleading, and different strategies for defining risk should be explored.""",diabetes,"People with 'healthy obesity' still at higher risk of diabetes, CVD: Study",1624864499

When im high i try to go to a room by myself and correct it. But it takes time of course for the insulin to absorb and have that effect. 

My ex broke up with me because of one time i was high and he wouldn’t leave me alone. Even when i asked for space and i snapped. 

Im with a new guy now. I took time to myself and im with a really nice guy, no joke a dream man for me, and im terrified. It’s still new and fresh and when im high he understands i need space. But after a while im terrified he will start to complain. I can’t always be under 250. That’s impossible  I wish it was possible. But what advice does anyone have on how to calm myself when im high, how to warn or how to get my bg down quickly when with him with no side effects.

I go and see him tell him what I'm experiencing. He tells me your stressed you have a lot going on and your body is going through some healthy changes this weekend just relax and get some enjoyment.

Call doctor Monday tell him he doesn't get it. I tell him thats probably why I was seeing pixelated/blurry. He gets me into an endocrinologist for the next day (when I called she was booked out for 2.5 months). She orders another A1C and a 2 hr OGT.

I was saying things to him like ""Where's your dexcom? You don't have one because you're healthy!""... but then that implies I'm unhealthy. Or ""You don't have one because you're young!"", but again, that implies he will have one when he's older.

Today I went over my medical record and saw my urine analysis that they also did. Glucose is negative but Ketone says 1+.

After researching I found that 2+ means Ketonuria which could be indicative for diabetes. So 1+ is only an elevation. In the notes he wrote I should drink more. I do drink &gt;2L a day and only ever drink water. The test was done with morning urine, so maybe that could explain the higher Ketone levels?

Friday, I throw up and then can't catch my breath, and then throw up more, and still can't catch my breath so my boyfriend called an ambulance to take me to a different hospital. I was in full blown DKA. Spent 3 days in the ICU on an insulin drip and a crazy amount of IV fluids because I was so dehydrated. Y'all, if you could see the bruising on my arms from how they couldn't get my veins for simple blood draws and the multiple IVs I had to have, my finger tips from the HOURLY glucose checks... 

How something like bronchitis can trigger this is mind-blowing, even after 16 years as T1. This has been probably the scariest week of my life, and I am scared to even talk to my boyfriend about how shaken I am.

First time posting here. My family member waa diagnosed type 2 about 2 weeks ago and is having a lot of trouble.

She's drastically changed her diet and is doing everything she can and taking it very seriously but even some basic recipes seem to cause her to spike. For example, a cookbook she has recommended brown rice or quinoa but those didn't work and She was high for a while.

86,"Hi all,

I have been a lurker here while learning from your stories/experiences, but being new to this world, I find myself feeling like I need some perspective on this.

**Backstory:** got my diagnosis on 4/30 with A1C at 12.3%, non-fasting blood glucose at 405 mg/dl (no prior symptoms, first diabetic in the family). They called me into urgent care for treatment, I received two bags of IV fluids and some insulin to bring BG down. I was released with my BG down to 210, I was prescribed the glucose meter kit and 500mg Metformin 1x daily in the morning.

5/2 I started 500mg Metformin 1x daily in the morning. I started restricting my carbs (no more than 40 -50 grams total per day), cut out all sugars, and kept tracking my BG levels to learn how my body was responding to things.

5/11 Had first phone consultation with Diabetes Care Coordinator.  We set up a plan for me to have labs to confirm diabetes type and that I would have my A1C checked more frequently (every 4-5 weeks). Coordinator explained the goal for patients is to reach A1C of 5-6% range, asked if I would start taking a second dose of Metformin, I declined.

5/19 Got my labs done and confirmed type 2 diagnosis. A1C down to 10.7%, fasting BG at 217 mg/dl. Coordinator asked if I would start taking another 500mg dose of Metformin at night, for a total of 500mg 2x daily. I declined but said I would if I didn’t start seeing improvements within two weeks. I knew I was on the cusp of getting out of the 200s, and my fasting BG the following day was 180. I tightened the reigns a little bit more and started focusing on the exercise side of things.

6/23 A1C at 8.3%. It has been slow but steady work; I’ve been at high 90s fasting BG for the past week, and BG levels have mostly been below 150s for the past 3 weeks. My Coordinator is once again asking if I will start taking a second dose of Metformin.

**My question:** If A1C is a test to measure average blood glucose levels for the past 2-3 months, and if I was undiagnosed and untreated in April, still in the 200s last month (May) and only now steadily staying below 150s for the past 3 weeks, of course my A1C is still going to be on the higher side. I am new to this journey ... am I not showing good enough progress? Or maybe it's not fast enough? Should I be more aggressive and start taking 500 mg of Metformin 2x daily? I have completely adjusted to the side effects of my current dosage, so I don't think it would be too bad if I were to increase it; I'm just hesitant to if it's not really needed, especially after reading other members' comments about side effects on slightly higher doses.",diabetes,Am I being stupidly stubborn for not agreeing to increase Metformin dosage?,1624591911

I wanted to make this post because I’m tired of seeing posts and comments on here saying things like “I haven’t had a dessert in 10yrs” or “my lunch is a piece of salami and 2 almonds each day”. For people who are newly diagnosed and may come to this subreddit for information, it’s extremely daunting and depressing to think that has to be their lifestyle now that they are diabetic. Again, I support whatever diet and lifestyle works for you, but I wanted to provide a different perspective that I don’t see on here too often. 

I’m in my mid 20’s and was diagnosed with diabetes back in late February of this year. I had Covid in January, and after recovering from that, began to be thirsty/have to go to the bathroom all the time. After a few weeks of this, I finally decided to get a blood test and my levels were 460, and my A1C was 10.3%. I went to the ER the next day where my fasting blood glucose was 220. 

There was no history of diabetes in my family, and I lived an extremely healthy and active lifestyle prior, so to say it was a shock was an understatement. 

Long story short, I was diagnosed as Type 1.5 and have been on 500mg Metformin and 8units long acting insulin since March. 

At first it was scary and I felt like I couldn’t eat anything I used to. I had a sandwich on brioche bun for lunch nearly every day, along with dessert every night (ice cream, cookies, etc…). I never really ate a lot of vegetables, and thought that the rest of my life would have to be fish, chicken, nuts, and vegetables for every meal. 

Furthermore, I came to this sub and would constantly see posts of people posting their blood glucose levels at a crazy high number or large spikes in their CGM graphs with titles like “shouldn’t have had that slice of pizza” which made me think I could never have anything high in carbs again, e.g, pizza, pasta, rice, noodles, sweets. 

While I do eat a lot less of those foods, that doesn’t mean I had to cut them out entirely. While I no longer eat 3-4 slices of pizza, I can still have a slice or two periodically. I still eat sweets 100% every day, whether it’s a handful of chocolate almonds, an ice cream bar, or a 5-8 spoonfuls of Ben &amp; Jerry’s. I still have McDonald’s every so often, or thai food, and tacos, things like that. 

I wanted to post this to share that it’s ok to still indulge (somewhat) and have the foods you love, maybe just not as much as you used to. You know your body best, and I personally found that even if foods caused my blood glucose to spike to 180+, they always came down 2-3hrs after a meal. Again, I understand that just because something worked for me doesn’t mean it’ll work for you.

Leveraging breakthrough [\#ArtificialIntelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=artificialintelligence&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6813747083267362816) approaches, the study will collect and analyse voice recordings in several languages from both the general population and people living with chronic or infectious diseases, to identify so-called ‘vocal biomarkers’.   
   
CoLive Voice is led by the Deep Digital Phenotyping research unit of the LIH Department of Population Health and is set to run for up to 10 years.  
Through an anonymous online survey on the dedicated CoLive Voice web application, study participants first answer a detailed questionnaire on their health status, addressing clinical and epidemiological aspects such as lifestyle factors, self-reported symptoms, ongoing treatments and diagnosed diseases. They are then asked to complete five different voice recordings by reading a short predefined text, coughing, breathing deeply and counting, among others. Researchers will subsequently process the collected data and extract the most significant audio features, depending on the voice disorder, disease or type of voice recording.

Beginning this Friday I am taking a week long trip with my friends through Tennessee and West Virginia.

We are only taking day hikes and going back to a place to stay at night, not backpacking for days at a time or anything like that.

Therefore, I am pretty nervous about lows with the amount of physical activity I am going to have on this trip. 

Of course everyones body is different so certain tactics someone uses might not work for others. But if there are any avid hikers reading this that have any tips and advice as far as certain safety measures, managing blood glucose levels, calculating insulin doses, how to set up basal programs, etc, I would really appreciate it!

Hello, 25 Male

**Symptoms:**

most of the times sweets taste ""too sweet"" like some chocalate are just overwhelming, I didn't used to be like this if I remember correctly (I can drink tea with 3 spoons no problem, but some cakes are just TOO sweets), I don't pass out though so that is good I guess lol, just a taste thing, probably taste buds changes.

LOVE water, I drink more than 3 liters a day (0.67 galloons), and that is just water, not counting if I eat soup or drink milk or anything, but I still sometimes feel so thristy!

Pee A LOT, and this is something I had since I was young, I guess some people sweat a lot, I pee a lot,But my problem is that sometimes it is just too frequent, sometimes like 3 times an hour sometimes even if didn't drink THAT much water.one of my friends said that it could be ""small bladder"" but I don't think organs are normally different between humans?? idk not a doctor lol

Noticed that my sweat is a little more smelly lately? idk lol.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem is with the pee thing, sometimes it hinders my activities, like maybe during a 3 hour drive sometimes I JUST GOTTA GO (I try to not drink much before traveling), or sleeping, sometimes I wake up during the night (again, try to not drink much before sleeping and just move water on my mouth.or during my walks, sometimes I feel that my bladder is going to explode! and I like walking, used to walk more than 20 hours per week a couple of years back, now that is down to just 6 sadly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tests:**

I got a random blood glucose few months ago and was less than 100 mg/dl, same for a year ago.

Now I went to do a fasting blood glucose and urine test, 108 mg/dl and it says within normal range (less than 110) but according to most google results is is within prediabetes range., I'll attach results at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

now I'm going to pay more attention to food and work out more after my second dose for covid in a month, I plan on losing a bit of weight (I'm 180 and 78 KG, 24 BMI), maybe likes 5 Kgs or something.

&amp;#x200B;

but not really that worried about diabetes, I have been less active in the last year and half and have gained some weight, also our died here have carbs every meal (bread or rice).

Also I've been on Inderal (Propranolol/ Beta Blockers for migraine) for 6 months now (started after my last results that showed normal on RANDOM blood test), read few studies from google and it appears that beta blockers increased glucose in blood (while keeping insulin level unchanged).

Recently I had some issues taking my Novo Rapid insulin before eating.
Usually the time that I wait when I take it before eating is ~30 minutes for breakfast, ~20 minutes for lunch, ~10 minutes for dinner and ~15 minutes for snacks.

The issue is, that the last few days, when I wake up (with normal sugar level under 160), take my insulin and wait 30 minutes, my sugar level still rises after breakfast to like 240 (and then goes down again). My doctor always tells me not to wait to eat more than 30 minutes after taking insulin, as there could be a hypo before I eat and for this reason I feel kinda scared to try.

What can I do to ""flatten the curve"" and prevent my sugar level from rising after breakfast? Is there a way to do it without taking insulin earlier? Does anyone here wait more than 30 minutes after taking insulin?

I got fired from a job about a month and change ago because I was anxiously checking my phone and/or using a bathroom break to check my phone in private.

I was checking my phone because I had run out of insulin, and was actively and anxiously waiting for a message from a pharmacist or endocrinologist to start the process of getting my prescription filled. Real bullshit hours, right?

I've already contacted the EEOC, and because of some technicalities, my case is not something that is prosecutable under federal law. Apparently. (I took the job for health insurance. So being let go over a health care matter feels extra-wrong)

I'm hurting, and the crap about systematic employment law being on the side of the employer, and not the employee hurts extra.

It hits especially hard, since I had just started to feel like maybe it was worth it to pursue a social life that might include romantic interests. But no, apparently corporate interests mean I can't have stable employment, so that stability of income and insurance is not worth anything.

I couldn’t schedule an A1C test until a month after that blood test.

About 4 weeks later, I did an A1C exam and the result was 4.6%.

I've had a dig through the old posts, and there's some great info but I just want to ask outright - 

My elderly Mum, 70, was diagnosed with diabetes last year. She currently takes both long acting insulin (Lantus) and fast acting insulin (Novorapid). There is still much confusion around whether she is Type 1 or Type 2, though Mum, her PCP, and I, all suspect she may have LADA/Type 1. 

She lives rurally, the only endocrinologist in the region is so overbooked they may as well not exist, and the medical center she's working with are pretty clueless about diabetes in general. 

We are wanting to confirm definitively whether she is Type 1 or Type 2, and I understand blood tests for c-peptides and GAD autoantibodies are the way to go for this - is this correct?   
If so, what type of results would show she's Type 1 over Type 2? For instance, would the c-peptide be low/high/not present/present, etc?

I hope this makes sense! I know that misdiagnosis is really common, so I'm hoping others who have been through this tiresome rigmarole will be able to help.

Backing up a bit. Last year my primary care doctor suggested the Freestyle Libre system to me as I was having issues with my A1C/Blood Sugar.  With insurance I have been paying $74.99 a month for the sensors and thanks to a combination of living in a US State known for being on (literal) fire I've also received 8 or 9 replacement sensors for the company due to them falling off...yes even with skin pre-adhesive AND overwrap.  These ""extra"" sensors threw me off of a set replacement schedule and so when my Insurance renewed at the beginning of May I did not need to pick up a new prescription right away.  Last week, once my sensor ran out of course, I realized I had no more refills left on my prescription so I reached out for refills and this is where the fun began. I'll make a list so it's easier to follow.  


* Didn't realize I was out of sensors until my last one ran out. 
* Called the pharmacy to have them put in a request with the doctor for a new prescription.
* The pharmacist requested a READER instead of sensors.
* Reached out to my primary care doctor to ask for the sensors.
* \*insert confusion over me not knowing it was the pharmacist who requested the reader and thought it was the doctor office staff\*
* Get things straight with doctor office staff and once the prescription is in, I find out that my current insurance does NOT cover the Freestyle Libre.
   * This took TWO phone calls as I was told ""yes it's covered and only $15"" by one person and ""you're pharmacy is using the wrong NDC"" by the second person. In reality both were seeing coverage approved for the TEN day system which has been discontinued but not in their formulary. Freestyle Libre is currently 14 day only. 
* Question if my other insurance even did as the price the pharmacy is showing is the same $74.99 I've been paying for the past year.
* Made ANOTHER insurance call and found out that the Dexcom G6 program is covered at a $15 copay for the transmitters/sensors/reader
* Asked my primary care doctor's office if I can switch to the Dexcom system. They say yes and sent over prescriptions.
* This afternoon I saw my pharmacy has prescriptions ready for the sensors and reader but NO transmitters.
* Sent ANOTHER message to my doctor's office asking about the transmitters.

In the middle of all of this as well I noticed I'm running low on Insulin so I sent a message to my Endo and her office put that in just fine so clearly some things DO work.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just SO frustrated at all the work this is taking to get a prescription and the repeated instances between the pharmacist (who was also rude AF to one of the insurance people when she tried to reach out to them for me) and my primary care doctor's assistant.  Currently I am on short term disability due to a bunch of health issues and I can't imagine how I would be able to get all this back and forth done if I was still working 40 hours a week.  This is just insane.

43,"Back in June of 2020 my husband and I went to the doctor due to difficulties getting pregnant. Doc ran an A1c and found it to be 6.4 as well as found a Thyroid problem. (Hashimotos Autoimmune disease).

She ordered a 2 hour glucose tolerance test, which I failed at the 1 hour mark at 211, and 181 at the 2 hour mark.

We immediately started correcting the problems as well as working on weight loss.

By December, I had lost 70 pounds and found out we were finally expecting! (Due September 2021)🥳

My A1c rapidly fell after the overhaul. Almost 0.5 or more every 3 months. As well as a almost completely stable home blood check of 70-85 fasting and my highest 2 hour post meal I can recall was 108.

As of March of 2021 my doctor checked my A1c and I was at a 4.9 (from 6.4 to a 4.9 in 9 months).

I have recently switched doctors and am 26 weeks pregnant and still maintaining a fasting below 90, and it's not unusual for my 2 hour post meal to be back in the 80s or low 90s but due to the diagnosis I check my blood sugar 4 times a day.

With seeing these results every day I am thinking of getting a second opinion on the diabetic diagnosis once I have the baby.

Am I crazy for thinking the diagnosis may have been incorrect due to an imbalanced hormone issue stemming from a unchecked thyroid disorder?

So I just got my results back and my blood sugar is at 116 mg/dL. Of course I had to google it up and panic myself and now I’m depressed.

I also thought about purchasing a blood glucose monitoring system so I can help my doctor. Any recommendations on which ones? I know they’re pretty expensive, but I just want an idea of how my blood glucose is. 
Btw I’ve never been told I’m pre diabetic,

My avg. 30 day blood glucose is 108 according to my CGM. I’m having my first A1C next week since initial diagnosis and I’m hoping for something around 6. 

However, sometimes when I eat meals my glucose spikes to 170-180, about an hour after eating. Usually by 2hrs it’s down to 120-140 range, and my fasting is consistently below 100. 

I’m wondering, do people who take rapid acting insulin do so to keep their numbers even lower right after they eat?

So im new to all of this and currently in the phase where I feel like i’m studying for a nutritionist exam.

My question is - my numbers seem low in the mornings (normally around 4.3 to 4.7) and all I seem to read is how everyones numbers are high in the mornings?

I stop eating at 8:30pm at night and have tried to stick to this for years. I go to bed at about 10:30/11pm and am asleep by 11:30pm most nights

My husband wakes at 6am for work, meaning I also wake up at 6am, but I have no need to get up until about 8:30am/9am so mostly scroll on my phone in summer, and in winter I go back to sleep. I’ll eat breakfast at 9:30am before I start work at 10am. (I work from home)

So I am fasting for 13hrs - is this not advised? I get the impression my low numbers might be me ‘cheating’ unintentionally as i’ve read you need to test first thing when you wake up… but 6am, is that really what I need to do? Or am I ok continuing testing at 9am before breakfast?

20,"All types of diabetes is worsened by dietary fat. People who follow a low fat, high carb(not process foods) plant base diet use less insulin and have better glucose control. Like a banana is apparently bad for you but a T-bone steak is fine 😀. Red meat is a carcinogen (classified by the W.H.O) and now it’s good for you? no way! Also, no we’re not all different, we’re one specie. Following low carb is dangerous because it puts you at risk for other chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. 

I’m aware this is just one study, and I’m not making my claim solely on it. But this is for anyone who’s gonna ask for a reference since I’m the one making the claim. There are more studies, videos, and articles on intramyocellualr lipid. Let this be an open door for you to start learning on you own, and start making an informed decision. 

Anecdote: was dealing with idiopathic small fiber neuropathy for over 2 years. I figured out it was being caused by pre-diabetes via an oral glucose tolerance test. I was following a plant base diet for over a year but my neuropathy was still progressing, until I lowered my fat consumption from 30 to 45% of total calories to 10 to 15% and increasing my carbs(fruits, vegetables) to 60-80%. Protein I keep around 10-20%. SFN significantly got better, IBS improved, less migraines, better mood, less fatigue, less muscle pain. Also because I got improvement in fatigue &amp; pain reduction that allowed me to exercise more which by that factor, also improves diabetes &amp; neuropathy. Prior before the change I couldn’t even go for walks without getting stabbing pain in my feet &amp; including fatigue.

29,"TL:DR - Freestyle Libre is constantly reading 50-60 points (or about 80-100%) lower than finger prick.  Started a new sensor, same thing.

So I'm kind of new to a CGM, got a Freestyle Libre about 2 months ago.  Initially I used it for about 2 weeks and then met with my Endo to review.  It looked like I was going really low at night, so my endo switched up a few of my meds to compensate and it seemed to have worked.  

I went through 3 sensors and things were great, I wasn't having to finger prick and was getting a LOT of new data and it was great.  I've not had issues with it coming off or anything either, which I was nervous about.

Queue last Monday, June 7th.  I put on a new sensor, and let it activate.  I noticed a seemed a little low that night, so I took a little sugar and seemed fine for the night.  Next day was ok but still seemed a little lower than normal, but I was thinking maybe I'm just having better control and results since I can see more data and adjust more accurately.

That Tuesday night, since I'd been running a bit low most of the day, I had tacos for dinner, and had 4.  A lot more than I'd normally have.  Within 2 hours of dinner I was down to 79, which is really wild.  I drank some poweraid, and after a full large poweraid was only up to 95.  I didn't feel low, but at that point was still thinking it was accurate.  My readings the next day were all running low again.

That night, the 9th, I measured before bed, and noticed I was at 64 and steady.  I didn't feel off so I did a finger prick.  Finger prick said 125.  I checked again, different finger, made sure it was clean and dry, 123.  So now I'm thinking it was a bad sensor.  The next day I would finger prick after checking the sensor, and had readings such as Libre showing 80, finger prick shows 128.  Also, Later in the evening, Libre showed 99, finger prick showed 151.

So I called my endo the next day, they also thought bad sensor.  I called Abbott the next morning, it took a bit of talking to them but they sent me a new sensor.  I kept the old one on and just assumed it was 40-60 points low.

I switched out the old sensor for another I had after a few days, I didn't want to right away but I don't like not having a backup, and only getting 2 14 day sensors for a month is dumb.  So I switched this last Monday, the 14th.  It seemed more reasonable and was still a little lower than the finger prick, but only by about 20 points, so within reason.

Just now, I had a decent lunch about 3 hours ago, and sensor is saying 63 and dropping fast.  I don't feel low, and definitely not high, so I finger pricked, and it says 116.

So, sorry about the novel, so are there other factors that could be making my Libre constantly read way low?  I've read a vitamin C supplement could do that, which I used to take for allergy season, but I stopped completely 2 months ago.  I take a calcium and magnesium supplement and sometimes zinc and Vitamin d3 and MK-7.

Are there other meds that would mess with the readings as well?  I'm on a mess of things for a few issues including Diabetes.

Thanks for any ideas, even weird ones.  I love how easy the Libre is to use and I get so much data from it, I feel it can really help me, but if I can't trust it to be even remotely accurate, I'll have to go back to finger pricks and just guessing.",diabetes,Freestyle Libre always reading significantly lower than finger prick - details in post,1623878579

A couple of years ago I had an issue where whenever I decided to sleep my blood sugars would drop. Like the opposite of the dawn phenomenon. I do get that also, but I can control that. I can be in bed ready to go to sleep for hours watching TV or relaxing, but as soon as I try to sleep they will drop. I can handle this with a couple of biscuits, but recently I have started getting an irritation in my toes when my blood sugars change quickly. Usually when they go lower. This feeling can last for hours. 

I know diabetes can cause nerve issues which can cause a tingling in the feet and toes, but it isn't so much a tingling feeling. At least not what I would call a tingling feeling. It's just an irritation. Clicking my toes helps but it doesn't solve the issue and it makes it hard to sleep.

  I have non-proliferative retinopathy, but started experiencing new/different symptoms on Thursday or Friday, that got worse on Saturday. 

Retinopathy has affected my vision, so I have a few areas where color isn't sharp. It's almost as if someone splattered gray watercolor paint in my vision, but I can still see through it. Seldomly, I have a halo in one point of my sight.

Before the weekend, I had floaters appear (which has happened a couple times before, but weren't cause for worry.) Shortly after that, a red shape appeared in my left eye vision. It's just outside my main field of sight (inner peripheral?), transparent, and I now mainly only see it if I change my focus to something closer or further away, but I also see it when I close my eyes (but the shape appears blue when my eyes are closed.) On Saturday the shape got larger, but has remained unchanged since then. That spot completely out of focus, depending on what I'm looking at.

Is this normal for retinopathy? Everything I've read online talks about gray spots/shapes/swirls in vision, but not red. It's different than a floater, and the blotch remains consistent, not moving or changing shape. I don't know if I experienced flashes, as i get eyes-closed visuals that involve light somewhat often, 

I have had 3 laser surgery sessions since December. My last appointment was 3 weeks ago, and the doc said everything was stable, and booked me a follow up/check up for later this month. 

Is this typical for retinopathy and how diabetes affects vision? If that's the case, I'll wait until my appointment. If it's potentially an emergency and I call and tell them, they'll squeeze me in but it won't replace my upcoming appointment if it's not urgent, and I can't afford to take time off work to go twice if it's not necessary.

20,"Hey guys! I'm usually just a lurker here, but I felt like writing this for a few days, and I got to it now.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my story is that I'm not a T1 myself, but my brother is. He actually posts here sometimes, and you guys have helped him a lot these past few months, so thank you for that! =) (And in case you're reading this, lil' bro, ""wadup o/"" )

 He was diagnosed a few months ago, on March, and as you probably know, it was **SCARY**. He went into a diabetic coma due to DKA and was in the ICU for almost 10 days, and since it was a public hospital (we're from Brazil), combined with Covid and all that stuff, we had very scarce information, only hearing from doctors once a day. Anyway, for a moment there, I really thought I was gonna lose him, and we are very close, so it was very very very (I can't stress this enough) scary.

&amp;#x200B;

After the doctors managed to handle the DKA he went back home and started living with his insulin. Thankfully we can afford CGMs, so he has an outstanding quality of life, and he's been thriving ever since. He gained a lot of the pre-diagnosis-weight-loss back already, and is doing absolutely fine. He also is a biology major, so he understands a lot about metabolism, which kinda helps in understanding BG behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, now that the context was given, my point is: **I am so fucking thankful that insulin exists, holy shit**. I've developed a habit of thanking whatever higher power there is (I'm a complete atheist, but I started doing this nonetheless after my brother got out of the hospital. My therapist said it helps give a positive spin on things. Thank for the good stuff instead of complaining about the bad) for the good things in my life, and one that always comes up is ""thank you insulin for having been discovered"", or ""thank you dude who discovered insulin"". Seriously, how great is it that you can essentially replace an organ's function with daily shots? It's fucking amazing. I mean, the shots can be a bit of nuisance, but what is a nuisance compared to the alternative which is... well... death?

Anyway, that was my whole point actually. I am just completely in love with the fact that there is a medication that gives my brother and so many other people the opportunity to have a normal life.

CGMs are also fantastic, but they're more of a quality of life and long term damage control thing, while insulin is an immediate life-death thing, so it gets the spotlight here.

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: Insulin allows T1s to live normally instead of dying. How f\*\*\*ing great is that??",diabetes,Insulin appreciation post,1623702925

22,"So last night my FIL (78) came over and had dinner with our family; we do this about once a month. We ordered some takeout. After dinner he stood up and started walking to the door, he started to faint. I was luckily right behind him to support him. After he recovered, he revealed that he's diabetic. It was scary - he said it'd never happened before.   


Of course, even though I didn't know, I felt terrible that I'd chosen relatively sweet and carb-heavy food to serve him. I've tried serving different kinds of food, but he has a limited palate - as do my kids - so it's hard to find things that everyone enjoys eating. He doesn't have great self-control, and I think he isn't monitoring his carb and sugar intake. He lives in a retirement home where a low-cal/low-salt/low-sugar breakfast and dinner are provided, but for lunch he eats mostly refined carbs, fried foods, and butter. He's divorced and basically never had to cook for himself before this. I know one meal a month at our place won't make a big difference for his health, and I don't think I'm going to get him to change his lifestyle, but I'm wondering if you all have any good ideas of what I can serve that is appealing for all and won't make my FIL's blood sugar spike.

This is extremely important since I am with child. This is my first pregnancy and I’m nervous about my blood sugars affecting the growth of the baby. I hear so many horror stories of sick babies or large babies because of mom’s diabetes. I am also worried that the further along I’ll be I’ll loose control over my sugars because it’s very common for the body to become resistant. After the first trimester, the placenta releases higher amounts of hormones and it makes blood sugars go wacky. I’m really relying on my cgm to help me stay on top of it all. 

My husband just got diagnosed as type 2 recently and he’s only 32. The dr suggested a gcm as well and I have been trying to help him understand the condition. 

We were talking about how we could find way to help the cgm stick because it fell off. His job as a construction worker seems to cause it to fall off from the heat or catch during hard labour. 

His brother said that they were just tracking chips. I argued that there’s no need to have such thing but he just argued that I was wrong. He is also refusing to get vaccinated and encouraged my husband not to as well.

13,"Hello! I was looking at other subreddits to post this but honestly this one seems the most fitting and doesn't break any rules. Hopefully this won't be too long of a post.

So I (19F) have been struggling a lot with my body and how I see it, especially in the past year (I was diagnosed with type 1 in November). At the beginning of 2020, I would say I was around 130lbs~ but am not sure as I never weighed myself. I'm around 5'5 and I definitely put on a bit of weight and was ridiculing myself for it. However, as the year went on I noticed I was losing weight without doing anything and thought it was great (little did I know...).

My clothes were beginning to become way too lose around my hips; all of my pants would fall down and I had to tie them up as tight as possible and just bought smaller clothes after giving up. My family was making comments about my body and how they could see my bones (especially noticeable on my back how thin I'd become). So by the time I was greeted with the news I was a diabetic, I was just under 99lbs. The weight loss was extremely rattling, as I was enjoying being skinnier but I knew it was not healthy.

Now here I am, nearly seven months later and back to my usual weight of around 122lbs (what my average weight usually is). I know I look much healthier, but with all of the weight gain and loss in such a short amount of time, I'm more confused and frustrated with my body more than ever. Somedays I'll think I'm too big, somedays I think I still look skinny. I've already struggled with accepting and loving myself, but with the diabetes thrown on top it's become even harder.

I'm hoping if you've read this whole post, you can share how you've dealt/dealing with accepting or figuring out how to accept your body. Even share your own struggles in the replies. Again, I really hope this is the right subreddit to post on because I don't think this relates to BDD (as I'm not going to self diagnose myself) and the Body Image subreddit seems to not be active anymore.

15,"This week was one for the books.  Looking for folks who have had similar issues of
1.kidney stones
2.kidney infections
3.Hormone Replacement Therapy (testosterone/ Female)

So.  This week I've had confirmation yet again of long standing ""infection"" (been battling since April 7, so 60 days now) 4 rounds of antibiotics plus one during surgery.
Very tired.  Sugar checks have been normal for me.  120-185 (I said normal FOR ME)
Had a CT at urologist to check bladder/ kidney before cysto procedure in office. Started having horrible pelvic pain walking from CT to exam room.  Urologist immediately checked scan to find 4mm stone in kidney.  Although,  i'm pretty sure it moved itself to ureter at this point. We went ahead with cysto. AND installation of testosterone pellets as I was low.  (I'm F/44yo and yes Females do experience low T)
Urologist suggests a procedure to remove the stone as early as Friday.  This was on Wednesday. I second guessed because my last stone I passed with no issues in less than 48 hours.  But I scheduled this ""simple"" procedure after hearing it could last 4-6 weeks and could get lodged and all the other WCS (worst case scenario)she was marketing.  Got all my pre op done the next day including xray, more bloodwork, etc. Go home Thursday night. Really don't want what really isn't a ""simple"" procedure and drink all the water I can handle and by God, pass a stone and catch it.  I showed up at hospital and said but wait,  look what I have. (I am also pain free at this time)  She didn't want to let me go,  so ordered another CT. Sorry.  That's not your whole stone.  We're showing it in the ureter (told y'all it moved) and it could get blocked and that would be bad for your kidney. We do it.  Cysto, laser, remove, place stent, send home. I stayed in massive pain all weekend even through the narcotics prescribed.  Urinating what looks like Dr pepper. Sick AF.  Call doc Monday morning.  Nurse says it's probably just pain from stent. Oh and you can take out your stent tomorrow! W.....T....F....? me? Okay. Pain increases enough i am down for it.  
So I do.  And I feel gloriously pain free! For about 15 minutes.  Then I'm pretty sure I died and gave birth to a fire breathing dragon in my pelvis.  Someone in the ER must have experienced this pain before because they were incredibly accommodating and inexplicably fast. I was asked for a urine sample and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who almost passed out at the sight of it.  I was wheeled around to get my THIRD CT scan of the week.  (No stone,  just major kidney swelling) Then taken back to my room for some angel of mercy named Jordan to administer the elixir of the gods and just let me sleep.  He's also the only one to jab me through the week and not leave a big bruise.  Holla. Anyway,  at home pain kicked up again,  so as soon as urologist was open,  I was there.  And she ""corrected"" my meds and said yeah... still some kind of infection, but according to renal ultrasound we have ""significantly less"" swelling. 
Anyway,  I'm already feeling a crap ton better and I've weaned off one of the pain meds.  Throughout this,  I have been off my metformin about a week now (1,000mg 2xday).  I've been checking and haven't been out of range.  I have kept my glimiperide 2mg and I've been taking it in the daytime just to make all the meds scheduling easier.  The big shocker is my numbers have been more like my goal numbers than over 2 years of being on metformin. Like, I'm getting consistently under 110.  Could this be the testosterone? I can't think what else has changed. Maybe a bit more water,  but it was pretty much all I drank before. Maybe 24-32oz more per day.  Just trying to see if anyone has a similar story,  maybe you have seen some research I Haven't found yet,  etc.

As time has gone on the smell got stronger and stronger. Now it sometimes smells like acetone and other times it has a sweet/fruity quality to it. I know these are signs of diabetes so I took him to the doctor. He’s also been super lethargic and drinks a lot. The doctor said he’s just tired because he’s eating too much fruit/not enough protein and then his blood sugar is spiking and crashing. I said he’s always asking for drinks and she just scolded me for giving him juice and said he’s not eating because he fills up on milk. She also said he’s a healthy weight so she’s not concerned. She did bloodwork and urine test but the blood work showed normal glucose and no ketones (she didn’t check his a1c). I had a meter and ketone strips lying around at home from pregnancy so I started testing him and it’s never been higher than 135. Usually it’s around 105ish. I’ve only tested 5 times though because I ran out of strips. The doctor and nurses are telling me there’s nothing wrong, and I understand his lab work was normal and I haven’t found any high readings at home, but that smell in his Urine has to be a sign of something. Last night his diaper leaked onto his shorts and the shorts absolutely reak of acetone. What do I need to do? Take his smelly shorts to the doctor and ask them to smell it? Bag up his diaper and bring to them? This is so frustrating. If it’s not diabetes, fine, but it’s still not normal for urine to smell like this. I really hate feeling dismissed by doctors.

Im planning on doing a bit of experimentation the first couple days (getting a good read for my basal insulin on the first day so i know how to adjust it, 
2. Day is gonna be how much does 1unit of dextrose raise my bloodsugar how much does 1 unit of insulin Lower my bloodsugar and a carb to insulin ratio
Day 3-end are just gonna be a non eating fast potentially finding out how long glucose storage in the liver and muscles last)
Im probably also gonna work out during that time but cut back on running since i burn through to much glucose even when only moderately excersising 

My doctors are informed, i have a Hba1c of 6.2 and am all around pretty well managed. 

Im planning on doing multiple day long fasts in the future aswell for their health benefits, not for religous reasons (something I couldn't do while being on injections)

Diabetes medications can suppress immune response. In addition medicines used in the treatment of severe Covid-19 such as steroids and IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab), suppress immunity.

Presence of uncontrolled [diabetes](https://www.drvamar.com/best-bariatric-and-diabetic-surgeon-in-hyderabad/) and indiscriminate use of steroids to treat Covid-19 lead to mucormycosis.

Mucormycosis affects eyes, nose, nasal cavities and brain. Symptoms include facial swelling, loose teeth, headache, stuffiness in the nose, black nasal discharge, blurring of vision. Severe infection can lead to blindness, seizures, blood vomitings and altered sensorium.

Maintain hygiene, regularly use povidone-iodine mouth washes, use masks, maintain social distance, avoid crowded places, garbage dumping sites and construction sites. Keep your blood sugars under control.

He was diagnosed ""pre-diabetic"" by his GP last week with a glucose reading of 366 and A1C of 9.6(!) which was way, way out of pre- range and into full blown diabetes. He made it clear that it was still possible to reverse this, which I believe is still possible with work. But is there any reason why his doctor would tell him this despite those numbers? Is there anything in his reports beyond those two numbers that would back up his claim?

Or am I about to answer my own question here by asking if he was told as such due to my brother's moderate to severe OCD and anxiety/depression to lesson the impact of the diagnosis?

I have anxiety/depression myself and it had been going off the wall ever since, having broken down and started crying several times between home and work, sometimes even at work.

He has been on 500mg of Metformin, twice a day at breakfast and dinner. We've had him on a fairly consistent diet ever since, taught him how to portion it. As of today, his BG rating was 105 after waking up. He ate breakfast, then at 12pm had lunch of an apple, beef stick, cheese stick and some almonds. He took his blood again two hours later, and it was down to 103. Is this good or am I misconstruing what I am reading online about what and where the score should be after eating?

All of the symptoms he had prior to going to the doctor have disappeared, but due to his OCD and other things existing and being such a hindrance for him, we're unsure if he knows about possible complications or that this could be a life-long fight. We're afraid to talk to him about it right now until he goes back to his GP in a month for a follow up.

He's always been a good guy, and of all the kids in the family, he has been the least problematic, yet he constantly has experienced health issues time after time.

**Dr. Lori Noble from Penn Medicine explains everything on her YouTube video. There's also a link in the description of her video to Penn Medicine's web site to learn even more.**

&amp;#x200B;

Diabetes affects millions of Americans, but there’s still a lot of misconceptions out there about this disease. Here, Dr. Lori Noble from Penn Medicine clears up what’s fact and what’s fiction when it comes to diabetes.

Diabetes is when your body is unable to regulate its own blood sugar and it comes in two forms:

• Type 1: Cells that make insulin are mistake and destroyed by the immune system. This disease is believed to be caused by genetics and certain environmental factors. There’s no way to prevent it.

• Type 2: More common in people who are overweight, inactive, or eat a poor diet

But what’s fact and what’s fiction when it comes to diabetes? Is being overweight a guarantee that you will eventually develop diabetes? Does everyone with diabetes REALLY have to take insulin all the time? And if you do have diabetes, does that mean saying goodbye to all of your favorite foods? Dr. Noble sets the record straight on diabetes.

In januarary I had tested my glucose at my new gp, as I had been told I was prediabetic at a hospital. After testing my blood with the gp they concurred it was prediabetic (122 glucose). I then recently got tested again as I am moving. When I was told the results, it was done through the phone. During the discussion, they never actually told me the new number, but just said that nothing changed and keep doing what I was doing. I then called the reception at the practice to get my results, which surprised me as my new glucose number was 134 and underneath it said this number indicated diabetes. Well, obviously I am panicking and called them back, to which the reception told me that the doctor would have noticed such an increase and sent them the message (as the doctor had moved tor another patient).

I've been diagnosed with diabetes since December 2019. In the first few months, I didn't really care about blood sugar levels(BSL) and ate a lot. (Not sweets tho) Plus when my BSL get high, ants are attracted to the commode after I urinate. (I do flush -_-;)Ants getting attracted to urine had been happening til about mid-2020. But now that doesn't happen even if my BSL spiked over 200. 

And recently I've been advised to eat only two meals; 08.30 and 18.30 but to eat as much as I can with [carbs only about 1/5], [1/5 veggies], [3/5 Fat and Protein] of the plate and not to eat anything between the main meals, whenever I get hungry they say to drink water. So I've been doing this for about 1 week and unlike past few months my BSL easily gets lower about 1 hour before my main meal which makes me happy. So they said to decrease the amount of insulin I take. 

Anyways obviously this must not have been the trigger but I'm curious why ants stopped getting attracted to urine when my BSL gets higher (And I'm pretty sure that was when my BSL was over 200) so even when my BSL is higher than 200, that doesn't happen. Kinda sus. So does/did this ever happened to you or am I the only one?(Ants' problem) and does your BSL ever gets lower than 100 even if you eat three meals a day?",diabetes,Do you guys eat three meals a day?,1623325703

Firstly I am a 25 year old male, 5 foot 9 68kg and I think I may have diabetes or something. The symptoms I have are:

\- Frequent urination (especially during the night, about 3 times)

\- Excessive thirst (I drink about 4L of water per day)

\- Trouble getting to sleep

\- Excessive sweating (this one has only started this last 2 weeks and especially at night and during working out)

\- Increased hunger (I have noticed this about the last 4 weeks ago or so but put it down to been back at the gym)

\- Blurred vision (started about 4 weeks ago but isn't constant)

\- Low sex drive (I don't know why but I definitely have this problem for the last 12 months at least)

\- Possible fatigue and tiredness (I have always put this down to working 6 days a week but I am not sure anymore)

I really love this thing! 

My arm felt weird if I had it positioned up/back (like if I was reaching behind me) for a bit there but it just felt *weird*, not sore or anything. It went away after a week or so and i haven’t noticed any weirdness since! 

The calibrations don’t bug me, that was something I was worried about; that I’d miss one and then be screwed, but so far, so good! I will say that my blood sugars that are displayed in the app aren’t always close to my glucose monitor. I’ve had instances where I’ve checked and the app is like 30mg/dL off but it’ll calibrate when that happens and I input the reading into the app, so it’s generally pretty short-lived. It’s been really helpful to be able to see where I’m heading (up or down) and that has been consistently accurate and, at least for me, probably more important than the number. 

I’ve only gotten one Ambient Light warning, but I ALWAYS wear some sort of sleeve and that day I happened to be in the direct AZ afternoon sunshine for a bit, so it hasn’t been too much of a problem for me.

The vibration scares the everloving shit outta me every single time— but it’s supposed to so I can’t be too mad! I also really love the app, the graphs are easy to read and I **especially** like that you can add a note when you input an event like insulin, exercise, food, illness, glucose readings! I always found it so frustrating in other apps to not be able to note like “I’m eating 30g of carbs but it’s pizza which is gonna skyrocket me, unlike most other foods with the same carb count cuz diabetes is the worsttttttt” 😂 (Note: there’s a character limit, you can’t *actually* type all that LOL) 

Charging the transmitter is NBD, takes like 15 minutes, but I wish I could temporarily suspend the vibration alerts when I’m in the shower (I change the little adhesive thingy after) and I wish I didn’t need to have the app open all the time cuz I can’t count how many times I’ve closed it accidentally and then get tazed by the transmitter and yell “OMG I’M SORRY!” to it like it can understand me 😂 It’d be nice if it could run in the background, but those are *really* minor gripes! I **do** like that I can see and revive the data on my Apple Watch too! Overall, I’m so happy with this thing! It makes my life easier, isn’t cumbersome, is straightforward to utilize… I’m really glad I did it.

As of yesterday I have officially been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes for ten years. I'm currently 25 and turning 26 in a couple weeks. I just wanted to write out my past ten years more for myself, but maybe it can help people on here that are worried about what is to come.

It all started in May of 2011 when my family went down to NYC for a long weekend. While I was there I had the classic being super thirsty and peeing all the time. We were walking across the Brooklyn bridge and were about half way across when I had a crazy urge to pee. With no toilets on the bridge, I could either pee off the side while tons of people walked around me, or I could run into Brooklyn just to take a pee. I chose the latter. I booked it across the bridge and only stopped when I found a bodega with a bathroom.

After we came back from Brooklyn, I was still super thirsty all the time and peeing constantly, and was looking thinner and thinner. I had gone to a buddy’s house and just randomly weighed myself on the scale in his bathroom. I noticed that I had lost around 15 pounds in about two weeks. I told my dad about it more as an “isn’t that interesting” sort of way rather than a “something is wrong” kind of way. He thought it might be serious so he booked a blood test for me a couple of days later.

Around that time in high school there was the yearly “Athletic Banquet” where everyone who was on a sports team got together.Awards were given out and we had a nice meal and dressed “fancy”. Well that night I was extra thirsty. I probably drank five cokes and a bunch of water. It was also a pasta meal and a pretty sweet dessert, but what did I know? I was just thirsty.

The next day at school two of my friends and I were getting prepped for a talent show(I was the guitar) that was happening that night around 6pm. Well, I get called down to the office around noon from my math class. I went down there thinking I was in trouble for something, but I wasn’t. The secretary said that my dad was on the phone and handed it to me. I spoke with him and he said that he was going to come and pick me up in about 30 minutes. He said that my doctor got my blood work back and called my house telling him that I needed to get to the ER as soon as I could because I had Type 1 Diabetes…. I didn’t really know what to think because I knew very little about diabetes other than the standard Type 2 Diabetes stereotypes. So, I walked back up to class and was just kind of quiet. I was sitting next to a really good friend in that class at the time so she asked me what was up and I told her. I put my head down and shed a single tear. I still remember my thought process,“Fuck, I don’t want to have to give myself needles. Oh well at least it isn't cancer”. I know, I know, diabetes can be super tough for some people based on my reading on reddit, that's how I was thinking and to be honest, that's sort of how I feel now... At the time I knew there were tons of people out there that were living fine with diabetes, andafter I thought that I was sort of okay with it all. I kinda knew that it may be reversible, but if it wasn’t, then I knew there was nothing I could do about it besides live with it and make the best of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I get picked up and we go to the ER. They tested my BG and it's so high that the meter can’t even recognize the number other than “HI”. I mean we’ve all been there before and it happens, whatever, but looking back on it I have zero doubts that it would have at least been at 40 (Canadian values). They took me in and I'm obviously really dehydrated so they put a needle in the top of my right hand and they started pumping two litres of saline into me. I'll never forget the weird feeling of ice cold liquid slowly coursing through my veins. Very surreal.

Remember that talent show that I was talking about earlier? Well to my 15/16 year old brain that's all that I cared about. So,I'm sitting there with a needle in my hand and im thinking “fuck, this needle is in the top of my strumming hand. Am I even going to be able to make it there tonight?”. I texted the people I was performing with and said that I might not be able to make it. So, during the whole time I was there, they gave me insulin to get my BG down to a readable letter and I kept hounding them that I needed to leave at some point to go play this show. They eventually relented and said that I could go, but I had to be back because they wanted me overnight in order to monitor me. It was pretty sweet, I went back to school at around 5pm and the performance was coming up shortly and we had been planning on practicing a ton after school, but now we were left with like 40 mins to get it all together. I still had the needle in my hand and it was uncomfortable but we still put on a good show. Some other friends tried to hug me when I first got to school and I had to back off because I had the needle in my hand, and didn’t want it all messed up. 

That was my first day as a Type 1 Diabetic, and that was the day I told a lot of my friends and teachers as well. I don’t know about you, but I think that's a kind of cool first day of being diabetic if you ask me! Everyone’s is memorable, but I think being able to go back and play gave me the confidence that I was going to be okay. It’ll be a learning curve for sure, but that's the only way to find out!

That first night in the hospital they woke me up every couple hours to check BG and gave me some insulin. Overall, it wasn’t that bad other than them being a little heavy handed with the lancet.

The next couple days were pretty much me and my family learning about T1D and how to manage it. The basics really: how to count carbs, what to avoid, how to give myself insulin and test. All that jazz.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to about two weeks later. I'm getting more comfortable with it all, I’ve gotten nothing but support from all my friends and family. I'm still in the honeymoon phase for my BG and my friends are getting more interested in the whole process as well. This all turned into people betting on what my BG would be at lunch every day and they would ask questions on what I’ve eaten that day and what my BG was when I woke up. It was pretty fun and it sure made light of the whole situation in a really awesome way. I always allowed anyone to give me insulin for lunch, I would obviously set the amount and instruct the new people on how to do it. So, I gave tons of people a unique opportunity for them to give someone a needle. It was pretty fun and never had any issues. It was ultimately just a part of being me going forward, so why not have some fun with it?

&amp;#x200B;

Having this lax view on my diabetes doesn’t mean that I was negligent with it. My A1C’s were always 7 or lower in that first year. I think that having a relaxed view on diabetes is a very healthy thing to do if you can because ultimately, there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. It’s sticking around no matter how much you want it gone, so it's best not to make it a huge part of your personality. 

Over the next year and a half I was on Lantus for continuous insulin and Novo Rapid for fast acting. My dad had heard about a study at a semi local university that was doing clinical research for getting the original Medtronic Enlite sensor approved in Canada. The program gave you a free Medtronic Paradigm pump, a year of pump sites,reservoirs, and six months or a year supply of the sensors for free. I was against it at first because I was fairly active and thought the pump would get caught on a bunch of stuff and be annoying to have on all the time. I did end up going through the program and let me tell you, moving to a pump is way better (for me at least). Conversely, that year when I was in the program was the absolute worst my diabetes was. My A1C maxed out at 9.8, and I attribute all of it to the first version of that sensor. I found it completely terrible, and my blood readings were constantly about 50% off. It was awful. I petitioned to stop using them, which they granted because they saw the bad results. That experience left a very bad taste in my mouth for CGMs for several years. I was able to keep the pump and I used it up until I had to upgrade to a 670G about two years ago.

I was around 17/18 at this time, but had been diagnosed just before my 16th birthday. Of course during that time in high school kids are wanting to experiment with a bunch of different things like drugs and booze. I was really worried about the effects that alcohol and cannabis would have on me. My mom had a boss with T1D that she had me sit down with and talk about alcohol and the effects it has on BG and the kind of drinks that he would order. It helped a bunch and made me feel more comfortable with drinking. I was still cautious though because I didn’t want to get caught drinking under age. I still partied a decent amount but I didn’t really start drinking until I was around 18. I had learned how my body reacts and how to deal with it as well.

I was really worried about cannabis more so because it was illegal rather than the effects it’d have on my BG. The Canadian diabetes center or something said that the effect cannabis has on diabetes was more so brought on by the munchies rather than smoking itself. I tried it a few times when I was 18 and kind of left it alone until I was about 22. I started smoking maybe once a week or less at that time and still smoke that much now . I find it very relaxing, and as long as I keep the munchies in check or have some low carb snack at the ready it's all good. I find being drunk much harder to manage BG than being high. Obviously your results may vary but that's what I find works for me.

I've just been living a semi-normal life. I went through college and worked for five years in finance. I learned a lot. I've had a couple of girlfriends in that time and they all have been understanding of diabetes and the small limitations/issues. My current GF I’ve been with for seven years and it's awesome having someone so ingrained in your life that gets how you react and is understanding of the issues that pop up from time to time. But I don’t rely on her or anyone else for support for my diabetes. It's awesome to have people to fall back on but at the end of the day, it is my issue that I need to deal with. If for whatever reason I didn’t have my GF, friends or family, or I had them and they weren’t supportive, I'd still have to deal with it. So that's sort of how I have taught myself to think about it and how I treat it as well. It's something that I can’t ignore, but I don’t let it take over my entire day. Sure it's in the back of my mind, but I don’t lose any sleep over it.

&amp;#x200B;

People ask me questions a bunch when they find out I have diabetes and I field all of their questions. I personally love talking to people about it! If they ask something that is misinformation, like the classic “did you get diabetes because you ate a lot of candy?”. I just correct them, it's no big deal that all their information comes from their grandparent that had T2, or comes from “diabetuus” memes. No need to be mean or rude responding back. Sure it can get annoying having the same question asked over and over, making it sound ignorant to you, but I love opening the dialogue up with people. I leave having made some kind of meaningful connection with a stranger I may never see again, and they left with some clarified information from a diabetic in the flesh! 

Embrace that you have diabetes, don’t get upset at people who have no knowledge of diabetes, because if you were like me, you didn’t really know what it was all about until diagnosis. People don’t know what they don’t know until they have to, and that is okay. I try to describe it as such, look at all of these various charity foundations around. There are a ton that you come across that are named after a person who died of cancer for example. All of the money that they raise goes into research because that family had to deal with the loss of someone they love and they want to help others in the future not have the same experience that they had. Now these families who started these charities probably only had a basic knowledge of cancer, for example, and they had to learn a lot about it and the variety of cancer now that it was in their world. So again, people don’t know about what they don’t know until they have to, and that is okay. Be a person who provides good information, try not to get frustrated. Sure it's easy to say that, but I have no issues. You can't fault someone for learning something new, can you?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that mental health can be greatly affected by having diabetes and the stress of it all. It may seem that I don’t have any stress, and my diabetes is just whatever, and there are a lot of people who wish they could have the outlook on it like I do, but if you’re reading this and are having mental health issues of any kind, diabetes related or not, talk to someone. Reach out to a therapist, a psychologist, a doctor, anyone who can help. It is worth it, trust me. I've had issues on how I see my future with my career and a lot of my stress came from my view on finances and how I was afraid to spend money. I had done some talking about life with my friends one on one in the past couple of years and that is great. You find out that everyone is uncertain and everyone has their issues, but your friends are close to you and the advice that family and friends, even though they may not intend for it to be, comes from what they may think is best for you. It doesn’t matter who they are(I don’t know if “ulterior motives” is the term to use), but they base answers on how they know you as a person and what they think would be best for you and possibly them. You really need a third party. I finally broke and decided to spend the money on a psychologist a couple of months ago and now I'm feeling great. I needed that push and insight from an uninvolved third party to give me the confidence in applying to new jobs, to actually accepting a job offer, and going into a really cool new industry. In all it was about five sessions that were bi-weekly.

You should try it out if it's possible and you’re having issues. It is not as weird and awkward as you think, trust me and I found its worth the money if you can afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it's been an okay ten years, I think? I’ve learned a lot, I’ve met a lot of cool people, and I haven’t let diabetes rule my entire life. I do pretty much what everyone else does. I eat whatever I feel like, in moderation of course, and I just make prudent decisions without burdening myself. 

I guess what I want to say is to have people who are newly diagnosed or just struggling know that it's okay. It's something that needs to be dealt with and you can’t run away from it. It's okay to have high or low BG every once in a while. It's okay to feel stressed and frustrated about it but that's not an excuse to totally disregard it. It's okay to have bad days. But most importantly, be easy on yourself.

Anyways, ask questions if you made it this far. I know it's quite the wall of text, but I'm open to anything!

65,"Today just sucked a lot and I need to get my frustration out to some people who will understand. Woke up low with a blood sugar of 52, drank some juice then ate breakfast and covered the breakfast like usual. About 4 hours later without food or drinks other than water I shot up to 267, and bolused accordingly. I have an omnipod and while my insulin was pumping my pod got caught on the corner of my chair and ripped the cannula out but it did not seem like it, the adhesive was still fully intact near the cannula, it was the back that slightly lifted. I check again, 355, so i decided to change my pump and when i took it off i saw the cannula must have come out of my skin and was being kind of smushed against it (cannula did insert properly when first applied). I didnt know how much to bolus since I still had insulin on board from before i bumped my arm so i gave myself 1/3rd of the bolus and waited. All of a sudden, 48. So i drink a glass of juice and eat a granola bar and start playing video games. Within 2 games I become extremely nauesous and dizzy and sweating and check again, 410. So I bolus what my PDM reccomends for that glucose reading minus about 2 units since it was getting late and I do go low a lot in my sleep. So I eat a snack before bed without bolus and lay down to sleep. As I was falling asleep I got the urge to drink juice without any thought and right when I set the juice down I could feel how low I was so I just laid down and kept drinking juice and ate some fruit snacks. After about 15 minutes of laying down i started to feel well enough to get up and check and I was 33! I could not believe it was that low AFTER about 2 glasses of juice and 2 packs of fruit snacks. That was about an hour ago, its 3 am and I just wish I could sleep, but I am feeling very relieved and happy things werent worse.

So every night I have to deal with BG that continues to climb. Tonight I ate dinner around 6:30 (grilled chicken and potatoes). At 9p my blood sugar started to climb. All the way from 100 to 180. I bolused twice in that time period 3 units at 9p and another 6 units at 9:30. It kept climbing until 10:15 when I went for a walk. (This is the only thing that will bring my BG down at night). 

BG crashes during my walk as it always does. Come back and lay in bed and the climb starts again. From 110 back up to 173 right now. Took another 5 units once it started climbing again. Which did nothing.

I am currently using the Omnipod Dash (which I hate because of the loud alarms and irritating sites); before that I tried the tandem t:slim 2017-18. And before that I used a Medtronic pump for 15 years. I switched to Tandem because the Medtronic Enlite CGM was so awful, and hoped that the tandem and then the Omnipod would create a better closed loop/automated system more quickly, but it was a long time coming and I have been thinking of switching back to Medtronic as they are finally coming out with a CGM that will not require constant calibration later this year (the 780G). But with the new tandem and Omnipod systems I am not sure which to choose.

91,"Hi everyone, I just need to get some stuff off my chest if that's okay. 

I'm currently 25 years old, I got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when I was 18 at a healthy weight. Some time after that I developed a restrictive eating disorder. Currently sitting at BMI 26 but it doesn't mean eating is going very well. I'm in treatment for it but it's focused on stabilisation of my eating pattern and creating a livable situation rather than trying to get better completely because it's been longer than 5 years and is considered chronic at that point so why bother I guess. 

I have cerebral palsy which limits how much I can walk but I'll always find other ways to exercise which my eating disorder then takes way too far. I currently have an agreement with my dietician to limit exercise to 2,5 hours a day. 

In December I started a statin for high cholesterol. I don't know if it has the same name everywhere but in the Netherlands it's atorvastatin. Since then I've been getting bad numbers when testing, though I'm discouraged from testing at all because it gives me SO MUCH STRESS when it's high. My hba1C increased from 42 to 48 and the last check up (a month after the 48) was 53 while exercising 4 hours a day. I've read statins can have that effect but my GP has never seen it so I now have a referral to the hospital to see a specialist. 
The diabetes nurse kept questioning the type 2 diagnosis and the GP agrees. We found out the actual type wasn't tested when I got my diagnosis. That's the other part of why I got the referral. The appointment is in a week (after 6 weeks of waiting so it's been on my mind for a while).

I'm on 3×500 mg of metformin and most days limit my carbs to 100 grams and exercising every day. I just feel like I'm failing and I'm always blaming myself. I'm trying to tell myself there's not much more I can do at the moment but my head is always screaming at me that I'm obviously not trying hard enough or I'd be seeing better results and I'm so tired of it.

97,"To begin with, My Fathers side of the family pretty much all have T2. My Grandfather had it for over 40 years, his sister had it, my uncle had it and my Father was just diagnosed 2 years ago. As such I've kept my eye on my sugar levels, and tried to keep healthy and active to prevent? slow? reduce the risks to myself. 


About a years ago I got an a1c and it came back 4.5. However I'm on meds that require liver and kidney tests every 3 months, and 2 weeks ago I got a call from the DR. that they've been tracking a slight (and I do mean slight) increase in my blood glucose over the last 6 months (106, 114, 153). They stressed, this may not be fully accurate as it is non-fasting test, and might even be just a blip cause by what I ate that morning. Nothing to get too worked up over, and we scheduled another a1c for my August appointment. 

Not content to simply wait until August, I've started to lose some weight, Not that I'm much overweight, I could stand to lose about 30lb.,  that thanks to Covid and the winter I put on. I do take the dog on 2-3 mile hikes on the weekends, and rarely sit for long at work. I've already dropped 5lbs

Diet: I gave up alcohol almost 30 years ago. I sometimes use it sparingly in cooking, but don't drink it ever. I rarely drink soda, usually a 12oz about 2-3 times a year. Overall I try to eat healthy foods more than processed food, but am not always good with this, and have very little willpower against free cookies/snacks. 

I also bought a cheap blood glucose tester with the plans to test once a week or so, simply to make sure my sugars don't jump suddenly. However I'm not quite sure about the readings I got after my first test. The directions say non-diabetic should have a reading of less than 100 before a meal, less than 140  two hours after a meal. I had my main meal 7 hrs before I tested, and a small snack 4 hrs before testing, and got a reading of 137. How many hours after a meal should it be before I should see the less than 100?

I don't know why it happens. I rarely get lows because I'm so high all the time but I'm really wanting to get better but I'm honestly scared. I don't know why it takes my body so long to react to fast acting sugar and slower sugar. This past week I've been keeping a log book with the data of the time, dexcom reading, meter reading, and what I ate and the carbs. More often than not it takes up to an hour for my body to react without insulin instead of 20 minutes or less. 

I talked to my doctor last week about it and I just feel like I didn't really get an answer. We touched on gastroparesis, but the only symptom I have is just my sugars so we ruled it out. 

Just a couple of weeks ago I was working my a1c down(slowly but surely) and I had an unexplained low and now I've back tracked. I think in this case it could of been it being a high fat/carb meal? Mind you, this isn't the case for every low that I've had troubles with. I've woken up to lows and had a hard time coming back up.

So if you want to also help me out on this second part as well it'd be greatly appreciated! (Also I made an appointment with a diabetic nutritionist next week!)

My recent ""low"" (I only got down to 108, but I didn't know how low I was going to go, so I acted early)
I went to work, and I was 402, I took a correction and by the time I ate lunch I was 232(my pump is set to correct down to 200 rn) I had lyumjev(equivalent to fiasp) in my pump. I had 200 carbs of taco bell( ya girl can eat okay). I purposely underdosed and only put 60 carbs in(I thought I was only underdosing by 40-50C but I was wrong till I looked it up to see where this event went wrong)
I took my insulin after eating, and within the hour my dexcom said I was 146. I honestly felt fine which made me happy, but I panicked because it said I was going straight down. I drank a soda, nothing changed. I drank another soda, then eventually glucose tabs. I stacked another 270 carbs on top of lunch. I didn't stop eating until either my meter or dexcom said I was leveling out. I just freaked tf out. Of course about 40 minutes after noticing I was 146 I SKYROCKETED. But ever since then I haven't been able to bring myself under 300. 
Did my insulin possibly kick in faster than my body absorbing the food because it was high in carbs/fats? I'm trying to relearn how foods can affect you, and I feel like if I knew why I dropped I would be able to go back to my ""normal"".

62,"Mods, please remove and contact me if this post is not appropriate for your forum. I'm hoping to get some understanding or direction on this issue. 

*trigger warning* potential theme of abuse

I'm an adult child of two diabetic parents: my mother and stepfather. I am not diabetic myself, but I cannot find resources online on this issue with my stepfather and thought someone could be of some help. I know this isn't something that is endemic to this community, and is more an issue of my stepfather, so I mean absolutely no disrespect to your community. 

My stepfather ""jokes"" that he is going to prick us with his glucose test kit. And by us, I mean my husband and I. I do not believe he has ""joked"" about it regarding my small children. This ""joking"" happened the last couple visits we've had, which have been very infrequent due to the pandemic. And the reason I say ""joking"" is because my parents have a long history of crossing boundaries and then minimizing it as ""joking."" 

We have very clearly told him to stop. I even told him if he ever pricked any of us (myself, my husband, or my children) then he would not be welcome in my home. But that didn't seem to keep him from joking or suggesting to us that we should test our glucose levels because they are ""probably higher than [his]."" My husband and I are both obese, but do not have diabetes. 

I don't think he understands how terrifying and inappropriate this behavior is. I later found out that he actually did prick my adult brother (with cognitive disabilities) while he was asleep. Who does this?! 

I don't know what his obsession is with other people's blood sugar. I don't know if he is doing this as a sick way of coping with the severe nature of his diabetes, which is apparently not well controlled. This issue is so bizarre and my mother seems to think of it as more of an annoyance than a serious behavioral issue. 

So I'm wondering if anyone in this forum has ever heard of someone acting like this, or can at least give me a reaction to this behavior? My parents have a good way of making it seem like I am overreacting when I am upset over something they do, so what I know as ""normal"" is often quite off from the average person.",diabetes,Distressed child of a diabetic,1623082392

Just seeing if anyone has similar issues or any insights to this. I got dx'd type one about 6 years ago in my late twenties and I know insulin needs can change for a lot of reasons, but my level of change seems insane. I have just about the most consistent routine you could have. I work from a desk 8-10 a day, I sleep 7-8 hours every night, I am moderately active but don't really work out. I eat virtually the same meals every week, my long acting has been 28 units for the past year and I don't take any medications other than insulin. Yet my insulin ratios will range from 1:1 to 20:1 in the matter of a day. As an example, I had a small cookie yesterday, my blood sugar was around 100, took 8 units and  I ended crashing into the 50's had to eat half another cookie and leveled out at around 90. Today I had the exact same kind of cookie, my sugar was at 95, now my blood sugar is at 190 and raising and I've already had 36 units. I should also mention that I am taking Afrezza which hits your system almost instantly and is out of your system in about an hour so I can see the effects of the insulin on my blood sugar on my Dexcom.

A leaf fluttering  in the wind can change my basal, so I'm attuned to my own needs. How on earth would a pharmacists be able to change dosages, if even allowed? I understand if they see something misprinted such as 100000 units per hour or something completely ludicrous, they would ask and double check, but to make suggestions? Did this happen to anyone?

Hi! I'm a type 2 who was diagnosed october of 2014. It's now June 2021 and I'm 28 years old. Over those years I've lost 50 pounds (not really trying that hard so probably due to being uncontrolled). I was diagnosed with an A1C of 7.8 and now as of recent it's at 12.5. 

I've been greatly in denial that I'm diabetic because i didn't feel the effects of it...regardless of peeing all the time. I yoyo diet with my carbs and sugars and can't seem to keep on a low carb diet for more than a week.

At diagnosis, I was prescribed metformin and my body would not tolerate it. The side effects hit me like a truck. I've avoided taking it. Even the ER version was horrible. 

I truly believe the only thing that has kept me alive is how active of a job I have. I'm on my feet for 13 hours a day and walk about 8 miles daily. 

I'm ready to take control. I want to have a baby within the next year and I know I cannot have a healthy pregnancy without controlling this beast. 

I'm going to schedule an appointment with an endocrinologist and get back into this and reestablish care. All these years I've seen a family medicine doctor but I need someone who specializes in this disease. 

I've been offered trulicity a couple years ago but I have a family history of thyroid cancer and don't want to risk it. 

As of the last couple months I've developed leg pain horribly! I'm 28 and don't want complications from uncontrolled diabetes.

At this point, I'm thinking of getting on insulin  to help bring my levels down paired along with diet and exercise.

I'm fairly new to being T2. I've had gestational diabetes and was pre-diabetic for a few years. Managed well on diet and exercise. Had to stop exercising due to an injury and illness. Couldn't manage to keep my A1C down much after that. Now I'm doing new exercises and eating much healthier than ever before. However, last week, I had an episode where I felt incredibly crappy, fatigued, and headache. Checked my sugar levels with a basic brand glucose monitor (tbh my glucose strips are expired because I gave up checking them as sugars were always fine), and my sugar levels were over 13. Never had them barely over 9 before.
So I'm assuming I will need to start insulin soon. Going to the doctors to confirm and get more info. But I thought I would go to my appointment with some information on what kind of insulin, monitors, etc I should request if needed. The last time I was just given some prescription for a random glucose monitor. But I know there are so many advancements on checking sugar levels and administering insulin.

I am a bit confused by my bg's reaction to my basal.

Lately I have been facing this issue in the evening with high blood sugars after dinner. I bolus appropriately, and most of the time over bolus to try to prevent these highs. However no matter what I do my BS starts to climb steadily and keeps rising.. Almost like the insulin has no effect at all. (My dexcom graph looks like the start of a roller coaster. Just a smooth climb upwards) 

The only solution I have found is to go for a walk and the exercise causes me to crash. However some nights about a half hour after the walk it will start to climb again. 

This issue used to happen right when I went to bed. I would be fine all evening, no snacking or anything after dinner, and 5 minutes after I laid down my BS would start to climb. However lately it is starting earlier in the evening. Some nights I’m taking half my daily insulin total between 6p and 10p just to try to stay in range and it’s still not working. 

I told my endo about this issue and her only suggestion was going for a walk. Which works. But it isn’t always an option. And personally it’s the last thing I want to do right before going to bed.

27,"My primary care physician wanted zero part of helping me manage my diabetes. He was pretty much rushing us out and would refuse to answer questions and also refused to test me for auto-antibodies. He said he thinks I have type 1 diabetes because of my age and that I am too young to have type 2 diabetes.

As far as I am concerned you can't be too young to have T2, can you? The whole time this mans body language was aggressive. I told him that my BG was at 500 last year and he had no good answer as to why that was.

Worst part about it was that the hospital scheduled an appointment with him, what was the point in going to the GP just for him to be rude and refuse to help? All that needed to be done was order a lab requisition.

Primary Care Doctor(D.O) told me that I needed to see an endocrinologist immediately, but no endocrinologist will see me for 3 months. What am I supposed to do here? I can't verify a T1D without the Auto-Antibody Diabetic Panel and I can't get a CGM/Pump if the doctor doesn't want to run lab work.

33,"Hello everyone,

I am the caregiver of a type 1 diabetic, I am currently residing in Romania and this my rant.

Insulin is basically free within our universal healthcare system and it is even affordable if one is not part of the national healthcare system.

Additionally there is a National Diabetes Program which has as its main aim the management of diabetes through insulin, tests, CGMs and insulin pumps for citizens afflicted with diabetes type 1 and type 2. 

The budget is not trivial; the estimated cost for a patient with type 1 that is eligible for a both a CGM and an insulin pump is approximately 6k euros per year. Most of the eligible citizens that apply for subsidized CGMs and insulin pumps usually receive them.

However the only major manufacturer of CGMs and insulin pumps that is officially registered in Romania and which participates in the public tenders for diabetic supplies is Medtronic.

Medtronic does not have the most accurate sensors, does not manufacture tubeless insulin pumps and to add insult to injury their products do not score well on a value-for-money metric. 

We are looping – Loop autobolus branch – with the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitors and the Omnipod Eros insulin pumps and we’ve had so far satisfactory results; both products are bought from abroad not without hurdles, alternatively one can get them from local resellers, albeit at a higher price.

Romania is part of the European Union, in theory and practice a free circulation zone for goods. Dexcom is officially present in Western Europe and in some of the Central and Eastern European states, such as Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Poland.

Dexcom is acknowledged by the European Medicines Agency – the EU equivalent of the FDA – and thus entering the Romanian market would be a costless formality.

Given that there is significant demand from both the public sector, via the National Diabetes Program, as well as private Romanian citizens that already buy CGMs and insulin pumps, I fail to understand why the major diabetes supplies manufacturers are not present in Romania, with the exception of Medtronic.

Maybe those that are knowledgeable about the intricacies of market access in regards to the main manufacturers of diabetes supplies might be able to help me. Is there any way to alter this situation as simple citizen? I know this is mainly a US community, but I think the reddit ethos might help me find an answer to my question.

It is infuriating to see one can get the newest electronic consumer goods in Romania, but not have official access to diabetes supplies which are essential for a decent life. (I could not even find the Dexcom app within the App Store available to Romania; one has to create a separate fictional Apple account for a country which is officially supported by Dexcom).

39,"Greetings,

My dad is diabetic, and with diet changes and exercise he's gotten his A1C below 6, though he's still insulin-dependent. There's a problem, though: most nights now, he wakes up at a random hour between midnight and 3 and gets food and it's usually something really sugary.

We think he's probably going hypoglycemic in the night, but since he's sleepwalking, it's impossible to test his blood sugar. He doesn't know what he's doing and sometimes doesn't even know I'm there or who I am. He won't let me check his blood sugar and he can't do it himself. Usually he doesn't remember getting up.

Is there some change we can make to his daytime routine to stabilize him overnight, or do we just need to pack an overnight snack so he has something for the inevitable midnight crash?

Thanks!",diabetes,Midnight sugar-seeking sleepwalking,1622704409
40,"I had a very upsetting realization the other day. I'm  waiting for a replacement pump so I'm flying blind without a sensor or easily accessible insulin, and I woke up very very high after a nap. I was so lethargic and nauseous that I barely made it to the bathroom before throwing up, and then just didn't feel like I had the energy to get up the stairs to the kitchen and get insulin and syringes. I texted one of the two people in the house and asked if they could bring me just a syringe and a box of insulin. First friend said no, I can't, I have a needle phobia, try asking the other person in the house. I texted them, they said they have a vomiting phobia so bad they can't even come up the stairs onto the same floor as I am because I had thrown up. And of course, because they're housemates and in the middle of a fight, they can't work together to get me the drugs I desperately need. Eventually one friend actually called a third friend who lives down the street to carry a carton of insulin and a syringe down the stairs to me. 

I did not take this too well once my blood sugars were back down. I get that you both have some mental health issues, but you could have helped each other. You could have had one person put the syringe and the insulin together so the other person wouldn't see it when they brought it down to me, a situation they agreed *could* have worked if you hadn't been fighting. Y'all really need to evaluate your priorities is you're willing to let a friend die on your bathroom floor because someone ate your leftovers out of the fridge (yes, seriously). YOURE BOTH IN YOUR MID 20S. 

I told them both I just can't be around them anymore. I'm sorry that this happened in your house, which should be a safe place for you, but you're both too immature for this to be safe. I'm sorry that I have a medical condition that doesn't play nicely with your phobias. I'm sorry my body doesn't work in a way that's comfortable and easy for you. I'm sorry you were very nearly forced to talk to someone to save your friend. My bad, I'll take my business elsewhere.

For background, I’m 25F 105lbs, 5’2. Relatively actively. Relatively healthy. My doctor said epitome of health lol.  I have not been formally diagnosed but concerned that it could be a possibility. 

Anyway, I’ve been tracking my blood sugar when I get up after eating my meals, before exercise before going to bed ect. My fasting is usually like 104-108 mg/dl. And my daily average ~111 mg/dl. 

From my understand of what I’ve read, 101-125 mg/dl is considered pre diabetes. I’ve also read as long as it’s under 120 mg/lb that’s “normal”.  

I also wasn’t sure from the information I’ve read if my weight and age play a part in “what’s normal”. 

I’m going to continue to monitor my blood glucose levels and eventually get an A1C test but mostly just trying to inform myself of this possibility. I take it very seriously and truly want to give myself the best odds so I’ve increased water intake, protein, fiber, veggies. More exercise. Smaller meals more frequently ect. 

I’ve also noticed, what type of foods I’m eating doesn’t dramatically impact my levels like I’d thought they would? I assumed: eat something high in sugar blood sugar would rise shortly after. But mine doesn’t really move regardless of what I eat. Is that to be expected?

I hooked everything up last night, but I used the reader rather than my phone to set up which I now think might have been a mistake? I can see that I can take readings with both the reader and my phone but they don't seem to sync?

This whole week my sugar has been under 300 when I've checked it. I haven't sweated as much, I'm not hot as often. I'm actually pretty cold sometimes. But I feel weird. And I have no real way to explain it besides that. I can't think of a way to describe the feeling I'm feeling. I'm supposed to go up to 1.2mg a day, but I'm worried if this is normal or not.

Basically, for as long as I can remember my blood sugar fasting has always hovered around 95-100, even while a teenager. If my blood sugar gets around 90, I start feeling hypoglycemic. I have had extensive blood work and everything is normal including thyroid and metabolism. Anyway, I got a free blood sugar tester about a year ago and periodically test myself since my father is now in kidney failure due to Diabetes type 2. His blood sugars are around 350-450. I have noticed that my blood sugar does not rise after eating....maybe 5-10 points and then goes right back to my ""high"" normal of 100. Is this normal or a pre cursor to diabetes?  
I have always been under the assumption that type 2 leaves you with high blood sugar that stay elevated, but what is causing my blood sugar to go from 100 fasting, up to 120 after a carb heavy meal (or even straight sugar like cookies or cake) and then back down to 100 or so within 25 minutes.

The issue is her morning reading (usually taken around 10am after she gets up - yes, we have odd sleep hours) are high. Over the last week they've been 174, 152, 179, 134, 142, 171, and 187 this morning. Throughout the day, even after meals, her numbers are much better. They're consistently in the 130s and yesterday, after dinner, it was 123 and has been as low as 117 post meal. 

She's very discouraged that her readings at bedtime are usually in the 120s or 130s, then jumping up so much over night. She takes her metformin with lunch (1pm) and dinner (6pm). Because of IF, she doesn't eat lunch (or anything) until 1pm. She usually has a low carb snack at 8:30pm and then is finished eating for the day. She is usually asleep by 1am but then is up 3-5 times per night to urinate before waking up to stay around 9:30-10. I've read about the dawn phenomenon, but can't tell if that's bad/dangerous.

When I was in a relationship I never had any problem getting up or lasting problems in any way. 

About 6 months ago is when I last successfully used my dexcom and could control my blood sugars very well and my a1c is currently 6.0 and has been 5.5 in the past. 

But I admit that many of my blood sugars are low levels because I’ve developed a toxic mindset growing up that low blood sugar is better than high so I tend to over dose during times when I don’t have my dexcom or when I go through diabetes burnout occasionally. 

I can no longer use my dexcom at the moment until I find a solution for contact dermatitis that the adhesive gives me. 

I don’t have any particular neuropathy problems in my hands and only have problems in my feet with tight socks. 

I noticed only today that my penis is no longer performing as it used to, I’ve noticed recently that it felt kinda small and off compared to usual but just put it off. Today is when I noticed 100% that it just felt kind of dead like something isn’t right, I can’t tell if it’s numbness or what but it’s just uncomfortable. 

I can still get off if I need to and don’t have a problem climaxing if needed but my erection just doesn’t look large and full like it was a few months ago. I’ve also noticed when it’s flaccid that it just feels shrunk and not loose, the same with my testicles.

4,"About a week ago I had an appointment at my endocrinologist and they did some blood work that showed I had elevated A1C at 5.8. I had not fasted. My glucose at that time was 94-I had eaten a bowl of golden Graham’s and a cup of coffee with milk and splenda 3-4 hours before. I got a call and was told to reduce my carb intake and retest in 3 months at my primary care doctor. Throughout the week I adjusted my eating some-basically no more Golden Grahams/avoid snacking for the most part, more protein, and measuring my rice/pasta servings so I’m getting what is considered one serving instead of just loading up on however much I want. I happened to have a freestyle precision neo monitor, last year I was having some dizzy spells and due to my father being diabetic and some other risk factores I got one to make sure it wasn’t blood sugar related since Covid basically made getting doctors appointments hard.I never got an unusual result when i tested, nothing was even on the high end of normal. I remember at one point testing my glucose after eating candy on an empty stomach and 1-2 hours after and my level was below 130. Today out of curiosity I tested on an empty stomach,hadn’t even drank water about an hour after waking up and it was 94 on the first try. I tested it 3 times total got three different results-94,86,89. All normal levels. For lunch my husband got pizza and I had one slice and 2 cheese sticks, tested 1.5 hours later and my glucose was 91. Now I’m questioning the diagnosis. For my own health and to lose my Covid weight I will continue cleaning up my diet as much as possible but is my diagnosis a possible false positive? I’ve had constant issues with low iron and vitamin D, but I haven’t had that tested since late 2019. Could that affect my results?

14,"Hi I am lola I am 16 years old with type 1 diabetes (diagnosis of 14 years), i’m 5”3 and 167 pounds so i’m overweight and I have just been diagnosed with extremely high cholesterol.  (i don’t know how it works but they said LDL was 14 and HDL is 17 or vice versa) 
(I live in Belgium so i have belgian healthcare) 
*Sorry for my english it’s not my first language

 I had my blood tested a few weeks ago and a few days ago I received a message from my doctor that I have to start taking medication (pravastatinenatrium 10mg once a day at night) my parents took very bad care of my diabetes when I was a child, which made it very difficult for me to take care of it myself. I was sometimes on high sugars for days without dropping. I know that it is very dangerous and I regret it so much because I am already experiencing the complications (poor vision, nerves that often just fail and now the extremely high cholesterol).
It is now for a long time that my sugars are normal and I hardly have high sugars anymore.  My only problem is that I don't exercise and I don't have a good diet.  I understand that my high cholesterol is also due to the way I took care of myself, but I personally think it is mainly due to my diet and the fact that I don't exercise much or not at all. My mental health has been really bad for years, I found my comfort in food and I couldn't stop after a while.  The hospital knew nothing about this as I find it very difficult to be honest about my mental health.  I read that high cholesterol is also caused by a lot of stress and anxiety and I also suffer from this extremely. My whole day consists of anxiety and stress.  I stress so much that I peel skin from my hands and lips and hair from my head.  I also do tooth grinding which destroys my teeth completely.  I have now received the medication.  Yesterday I read the leaflet and did some research and I read that you had to take this medicine for life with side effects that I would rather not have (paralysis of muscles, hair loss, sexual problems,...).  I have therefore chosen not to take the medication since my cholesterol can only get worse if I stop taking it after a while.  Since I think it's because of my diet and exercise, I want to see if I can also reduce it by going on a strict diet and basically making sports my life.  And making blood sugar EVEN better because it can definitely get even better than this. And when it comes to stress, I am certainly open to therapy and anti-anxiety medication. I am also open to becoming vegan. I would even starve myself to lower that damn cholesterol lmao.
 I'd rather do that than be chained to a drug with horrible side effects.
 I've also heard that you can do good detoxes with drinks like garlic with ginger and cinnamon per ex. My question to you is actually if it is safe or not to try it this way first?  I will of course also discuss this with my own doctor, but I would like to get an opinion from others first as my doctor has often prescribed unnecessary medication for me. She said she wouldn’t give this medication to people my age but if i don’t take it i could burst an artery. If i won’t see results i’ll start the medication. 

 (I also wanted to add that I have the feeling that I did not take my blood test sober, I had eaten a lot of fats and salt in the days before the test. I don't know if this had an influence but I'll put it here :) )",diabetes,Cholesterol levels sky high,1622310819

I haven't taken any insulin since last night at 7:30pm with dinner. I also had a bedtime snack. Example 2. My blood sugar was 115 going in to a doctor's appointment 7:00am. Hadn't taken any insulin or eaten for a fasting blood draw. Do this twice a year. Started talking to my doctor and my alarms start going off. It has been 20 minutes from my 115. When we look at the computer it was 28. I have no signs I'm low. I am still talking and walking to the area that has a bed that if/when I pass out I won't hit the floor. They know me. The bed is less then 10 ft away. They get me secure and start with the juices. At this time I start asking to get my blood draw done after giving my reason that I an missing work to do this they do this. That time I didn't pass out. I did have the whole office in an uproar.

Every month or so I have periods ranging from few days to a week of:
- being very tired, irritable, not feeling quite like myself
- excessive hunger and thirst
- sometimes feeling cold with shivers 
- sometimes a bit shaky
- can feel my heartbeat more
- get tired after walking the stairs and doing simple things 
- muscles feel very weak 

It can last for a week, on day 8 I’m back to normal and all these are gone. Nothing seems to speed up the recovery (rest, food, water).

In the past it (possibly) happened after:
- lots of exercises and not too much food
- eating too little
- eating too little and drinking alcohol
- possibly a stressful event (?) not sure

31,"Kinda long, I apologize in advance. I really need some encouragement.

I’ve had a long, awful five months. Lots of major stress. Christmas night I was in the hospital for pancreatitis and gallbladder issues. (Prior to that, I was doing great - I had decided in August that I was going to lose weight to get healthier, and I’d lost 30ish pounds by then, and my depression was lifting, everything was rosy.) I was in the hospital for 15 days while the doctors panicked over my very elevated liver enzymes (they were afraid of liver failure). Then they sent me home. I was told to stay on a bland diet until further notice. Because meds were making me nauseous they strongly recommended the BRAT (bread, rice, applesauce, toast) diet. I obeyed. My liver enzymes proceeded to get worse, so I’ve been seeing doctors and having tons of blood tests. They told me to keep eating bland. My meals were mostly chicken and rice. At some point I found out my hypothyroidism that I’ve had for years is really Hashimoto’s. Cool, autoimmune disease, fun times. No answer on the liver thing yet. More stress as I was in pain from liver spasms every single day. 

Then a month ago I found out my a1c is 6.5. I saw it online first, and had a breakdown because I knew what that number means. I spiraled into self-hatred. I can’t believe I let them tell me to eat all these carbs, which certainly didn’t help my number. I can’t believe I’ve let this happen. My mother had Type 1 before she died of complications. I should’ve known to be more careful.

By this point I’d lost 47 pounds, most of it through watching calories and taking walks. I had done so much - eliminated all soda and fried foods, whole wheat 99% of the time, only fruit or low fat lunch meat and cheese for snacks, never touched the salt shaker - I was horrified that I’d tried to get healthy only for my health to get worse. That’s not how the story usually goes...

The doctor didn’t even tell me much. She says to eat moderate carb, low fat (to help out my liver), low sugar, and low sodium. No meds because of my liver. She put in a referral to the nutritionist, but I don’t see them until next week. She told me she’ll test again in 8 weeks (so 2 weeks now). I’ve been completely alone except for ranting and/or crying to my therapist. I came here and lurked and got the information I needed. No one told me to get a meter - I finally ordered one today. No one told me of any support groups or anything at all. (Unfortunately some of my doom and gloom has been reinforced by this sub too. Please don’t remind me that I can never “fix”this. I need some positivity.) My family doesn’t know. They already struggle enough with my dietary restrictions. They don’t understand why I won’t eat ice cream, or a fried piece of fish. They keep telling me to just scrape off the batter, or it’s just a cheat meal, and while they’re full of praises for all the weight I’ve lost (62 pounds as of this week) I can sense their frustration.  Especially when I won’t do things that seem healthy to them, like eat a banana. 

I cannot tell my family about this diagnosis. I can’t deal with the shame. I can’t even say, “hey, I tried to get healthy, but with everything that’s happened my body is worn out and can’t do it anymore”. All I feel is shame and emotional pain. I’d been doing the right things and it doesn’t seem to matter. Now I’ve got this terrifying diagnosis that will follow me the rest of my life and it feels like a death sentence. I think this is what I will die of one day, like my mother. I’d like to ask the Universe: why is this my burden? The Hashimoto’s, Hidradenitis, liver issues, chronic anemia and vitamin D deficiency, anxiety, depression, and PTSD wasn’t enough? I’m normally someone who goes “well I guess others have it worse, like cancer”, but right now I just can’t. 

 Needles terrify me. I’m not on insulin, and I don’t want to be. This lower carb thing is making me miserable. I’ve never been so irritable. I’ve never lacked energy like this - and I’ve been very anemic for a decade! My vision goes blurry if I don’t eat enough carbs, but I’m not supposed to eat carbs! Now I’m scared I’m having diabetic eye issues or something. I’m terrified of food now. I eat a slice of Ezekiel bread per week and feel guilty. The only things I have left is meat and vegetables. And I guess dairy, but I’m thinking my Hidradenitis (another thing, yay!) is triggered by that so I’ve been cutting that back. I just can’t physically eat enough now that I don’t have carbs. I might hit 800 calories if I really try. I worry about the damage that’s causing. I’m just...exhausted by all of this. I don’t know how to live like this. I’m 31, I should be thinking about my career and a partner and future kids, but instead my thoughts are “how will I manage this at work? How would anyone put up with these mood swings? I can’t have kids, I can’t pass them these chronic illnesses”. It’s sad. I’m sad.

35,"So... my endo has been at me to exercise for years and I've always been like 'I walk, its fine'.

But recently I started a proper plan to get real exercise. I'm doing 10 minutes of cardio (on an elliptical) a day.

The plan is basically

Week 1: 10 mins Cardio

Week 2: 10 mins Cardio + 15 reps core strength

Week 3: 15 mins Cardio + 15 reps core strength

Week 4: 15 mins Cardio + 15 reps core strength + 15 reps flexibility

Adding minutes to my cardio, and exercises to my strength and flexibility week by week until I hit half an hour of cardio and half an hour of strength and flexibility exercises. 

I started a week ago, and start on my core strength exercises today. The thing that has really shocked me though, is how much my blood sugar is stabilized by just 10 minutes of exercise a day.

So anyway, if anyone is wondering about how much difference doing a bit of medium-high intensity exercise will make to your blood sugar levels, this has been my experience.

Yesterday I had really high ketones (4.0mmol/l) and contacted my endo and she gave me generic instructions and contacted me a few times that day. I managed to lower my ketones to 2.2 but then suddenly they jumped back high and I had to go to the ER. The weird thing here is that my blood sugar was around 10 mmol the entire day. They gave me an IV and my ketones got better and they cleared me out but we never figured out why and we blamed it on the stress which is the only major difference to my normal life right now.  


So today, my night blood sugar was within range the entire night (4-10 mmol/l) and I wake up to ketones of 1.8 and blood sugar of 9. Could it really be just the stress causing this? I'm using a pump and I've changed my insulins and the injection site.

I would say I’m skinny fat but not overweight (5’7 and 160 lbs). I’m pretty sure maybe I got this from eating a lot of fast food and drinking soda almost every day. I had always ate a lot of candy and stuff. 

What now? Do I start avoiding carbs? How should I start eating? I’m trying to build lean muscle mass from weightlifting and I don’t mind being in a caloric deficit until I get to a low bodyfat percentage. 

Does this also mean that if I do reach a lean bodyfat percentage (sub 15%) that I can no longer bulk for a temporary period of time to build muscle? Since that would be bad and put me at risk for diabetes?

75,"Two days ago, I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/nkwvso/is_my_cousin_screwed/) asking for clarification. 

Yesterday, I managed to talk him into seeing a doctor. His blood results a day earlier were:

* Blood glucose level: 4.24 g/l (normal should be 0.75 to 1.15 according to the results papers).

* HbA1c: 12.6% (it should be between 4 and 6%).

When we got to the doctor, he  took a urine sample, tested it for ketones and immediately told him to either go to a hospital or play Russian roulette with his life. That scared him. 

As I explained in the earlier the thread, my cousin doesn't have the means to go to a private clinic so we headed to a public general hospital. We live in a third world country, so you can imagine what those are like. 

We had to wait a few hours before ""a bed"" was free and they put him on some sort serum and insuline. 

They kept doing blood (for glucose levels) and urine (for ketones) test every few hours. I stayed by his side and a little over 30 hours later, they told us that the ketone levels are under control, they discharged him and told us to speak to his initial doctor.

We just had a consult with the doctor, and he told him to inject insuline 4 times per day. One before each meal, and one before going to bed. He also told him to use a glucose testing kit to keep an eye on his blood sugar levels.

His world just crumbled as if he was dealt a death sentence. He's confused, doesn't know what to do, what to eat, how to keep his ketones level under control without going to the emergencies again.

We have a million questions but we didn't get much in the way of satisfying answers. 

So I'm turning to you reddit:

* What should my cousin absolutely know about this thing?

* How does he go about managing this on daily basis?

* Does he absolutely need to inject insuline 4 times a day?

* How / When does he take blood tests?

* What to do after each test if his levels are low or high?

* What should he do about his ketones levels? Since he wasn't told by the doctor to watch for those, nor was he given any sort of testing kits for that.

* What are the symptoms of low and/or high blood sugar?

* What does he need to do immediately if he experiences either of those symptoms? 

* What should he eat, what shouldn't he eat? We had contradicting answers to his, especially when it comes to eggs, carrots, orange juice, milk, canned tuna, bananas.

* What affordable diets should he consider? 

* Would exercising help? Which sort of exercises and when is best?

28,"I’m a teen with T1D and they make my life so easy.

I’m completely self-sufficient in terms of glucose checks, insulin dosing, counting carbs, making meals, and putting on pumps and CGMs. Granted, I have to give a lot of credit to the Freestyle Libre and Omnipod for being so easy to put on, but that’s not the point. The fact that my parents are willing to treat me as mature enough to manage my diabetes by myself is great. They intervene when I really need help, but don’t micromanage when they know that I’m doing okay. (Just got an A1C of 6.4%!!)

My mom is also an absolute champion at getting these things shipped. It’s hell trying to go through insurance to get them, and even worse to try to get them in a timely manner. She somehow still does.

Finally, they make me feel normal. This kind of goes back to the self sufficiency thing, but it’s different enough to put in its out category. I’ve heard of teens who have their lives (diet, exercise, activities) completely controlled by their parents. Others aren’t even taught the difference a Chang of behavior can make in how they manage their T1D. Mine help me get healthy low carb food that I ASKED FOR, while also not putting the whole family on some crazy carnivore diet that no one really wants. They don’t eat twizzlers in front of me as they moan, but they also don’t make a point of making me feel different by explicitly changing their habits while in front of me.

As an example, my mom surprises me sometimes with funky vegetables, cheese, berries, and 90-100% chocolate. At the same time, she still buys my brother a normal birthday cake. No one would bat an eye if I went for a slice, but I choose not to because they gave me the learning opportunity to see what different carbs do to my body.

43,"So, I dont think I have diabetes, but... I think I have something close to it, maybe. Im not really sure. Or maybe its just type 1? 


I am overweight, BMI of 32 but my measurements put me more in the ""slightly overweight"" category and I work out frequently, so I'm more of like... a fat strong kind of situation. Not ideal, and Im trying to lose it, but its not that bad.

I am female and 31 years old. 


1. For as long as I can remember, I have had a strong sensitivity to sugar. I never ate sweets even as a child-- they quickly make me feel ill and cause headaches/light sensitivity/eye problems. I have noticed I have these issues as well even now if I eat very carb heavy meals, so I have started eating almost exclusively low GI foods in the middle of the day.

2. I have had reactive hypoglycemic episodes, or what feels like them. If I get really hungry, I get very shaky, start sweating, dizzy, etc. This usually happens in the afternoon when Im exercising if I havent eaten directly before. In the morning, though, I can easily exercise on an empty stomach, though it happens in the morning every once and a while. This issue started when I was 15/16.  

3. Within the past few months, I have noticed that my urine has gotten very dark and quite strong smelling. Not sweet, more like a ketone smell (I think? It kind of smells like when I was on a keto diet, so thats what Ive assumed). This also coincided with me going vegan though, which may be affecting my water retention. 

4. I am getting rather frequent yeast infections, about 2-5 times a year. However, I also take very long baths, usually with bath salts. This issue started about 4 years ago. 

5. I use the bathroom pretty frequently, but I think this is largely psychological. I dont have a lot of urine output, I just go a lot, because once I think ""I have to pee"" it like... gets stuck in my head. But I am still going probably like 8-14 times a day, depending on how much coffee I drink. 



Like I said, I got an AC1 test last year and have had blood glucose fasting tests about 1-2 times a year for the past 3 years and never had an issue. I cant remember the number, I have it at home and will look it up, but basically after looking into this with multiple doctors none have found me to have diabetes or even prediabetes.

44,"I had already been struggling with my mental health since 9 years old, then I get diagnosed with diabetes at 11 and everything just crumbles beneath my feet from there. I took the step today in the (hopefully) right direction and talked with my school counsellor, and I almost cried a couple times. Theres still loads I haven’t told her, but I told her most things about my depression and anxiety (also diagnosed). 
My family doesnt allow me to have any professional people (not saying my SC isnt professional, but you know what I mean) and they always tell me I have nothing to be depressed about. Anyways, my diabetes makes me feel so lost. I feel like the only way out of this nightmare is death, but I don’t wanna die, I just want the pain to end and for time to slow down even for a bit, but it never does.
Im not honest to my doctors or family about the amount of insulin I take. Im not entirely honest about my numbers either. My lunch, which is 60 carbs, is the one meal which I feel I really need to be able to function in school the best I can but I cant eat it because 7 carbs spike my blood sugar from 9.0 mmol/L to 14.5 mmol/L (yet im almost going low before lunch...smh) I also give myself more insulin at supper and nighttime because It spikes so high after.
I have a visit with the doctor soon and I want to be completely honest because this is eating me up inside. Im currently 13.0 and its going up. Its almost 1am and im tired out of my mind. I cant help but cry because I just think of everyone else living their best lives and I have to do all this shit just to be calm.
My biggest problem, I feel, is my family. They make diabetes more stressful that I think it had to be. I’m 16, growing and my body is changing but if my blood sugar is changing or its higher than it was the day before, it’s 100% something I did wrong so thats why I’m making all these independent choices just to try and keep my blood sugar stable so no one gets mad at me. I also hate asking for help, I’m too stubborn, so I try my best to handle everything on my own. Its most likely a flaw. 
Not to mention, I’m at the lowest point of my life right now. Honestly, the only thing keeping me from wanting to end it all right now is I have to finish reading the Harry Potter book series and I’m only on book 1 (dont bully me i was late for it, okay?) and the fear that it wont work and ill wake up and have to face the world again.

I avoided the idea of a CGM for years. Only person I know who had one had to finger test multiple times a day so the idea seemed stupid to me. The Endo kept insisting they are so much better now and you do not need to calibrate the Freestyle Libre 2. So I decided to give it a try. 

I'm on my 2nd device in 4 days. The first seemed to work fine when installed early in the morning but shortly after midnight I got a low alarm. When I scanned it said my reading was 68 and dropping But since I did not feel low I checked with the previous test strips and was over 100. I ended up turning the reader off to stop the alarms and by morning it was showing 54 while the test strips showed 122. I contacted Abbott and after explaining what was happening and testing with a test strip and the reader and also giving them the error messages and other info off the reader they told me to remove that one and install a new one and they would send a replacement.

So a new one was installed and again worked fine that day, When checked against my previous test strips it was close so I thought all was well. Until that evening. Again shortly after midnight the reader alarms and when checked says I am at 69 with a down arrow. Testing with the freestyle neo test strips I purchased that day said I was 97 and the accucheck test strips I used before this had a reading of 109. I had made sure the device was not under me while sleeping since I had read that could cause low readings and drank plenty of water to make sure I was well hydrated. Which was a bad idea for a 67 year old to do.

It stayed low most of the day and since I had read some were not accurate for over 48 hours decided to wait this time. It finally by evening was staying around 100 which was close to what the test strips said so I thought maybe its working.

And shortly after midnight again I hear the chirp of the reader
Again I ended up turning it off and most of the morning until fairly recently it showed under 60 readings. Now it shows 97 about an hour after eating and the accucheck shows 170 and the neo test strips show 184. 

I'm willing to give it another day to see if it decides to work since I read another posting that said up to 3 days  but think these seem to be more bother than they are worth. I have been reading all I can on low night readings and should have all the bases covered. The device is placed exactly in the same place the pictures show to put it. I am well hydrated and avoiding putting pressure on the device.  Other than needed Meds ( simvastatin, metoprolol, and azathioprine  and insulin ( novolog, tresiba) I am not taking anything else .

A few months back I got my blood sugar taken at the ER, I mistakenly ate something before getting there, it was 115 which wasn’t too bad especially after eating. If anyone is wondering why I went to the ER, it was because of anxiety symptoms, one of which was shaking, so they took my blood sugar to find out if it was low or not. A week later, I went to my doctors office and got an a1c, which came out normal 4.5. So my doctor basically ruled out my diabetes, but a week ago I went to my doctor again to check my lipid panel. Since I fasted he figured why not test my blood sugar as well, and surprisingly I was told it was high. I don’t have the actual results yet, I got a call from a nurse that said that my blood sugar was high, I forgot to ask her what it was. Is there anything that could potentially give falsely high readings? I’ve heard the dawn phenomenon, could raise my blood sugar. Which could potentially explain why it was high since I went to the doctors office right when I woke up. Another explanation I have is stress, I’ve heard stress can increase blood sugar.

5,"Hello all. Wanted to post and offer some feedback. T1 since 1990, diagnosed at 9yrs old. On insulin pump since 2001, first with Disetronic, then Accu Chek Spirit. In January 2020, switched to the TSlim X2/G6 combo just as the ControlIQ mechanism got approved and was coming out. At first, the setup was working great and was a real game changer. H1c's went from mid-high 8's to mid 7's. Then, Covid happened. Along with it came working from home, not exercising and gaining 25lbs or so, over the following 4-6 months. As a result(I think), I developed a fairly wicked insulin resistance. Any carbs at all would send BG skyrocketing and trying to bring it down was like pumping insulin into a black hole. Daily insulin usage skyrocketed from 80-100 units to 150-170. Both Humalog and Novolog were the same. Endo had me try Metformin(bad stomach problems and not very effective), then Januvia(also not very effective) and then KombiGlyze(nausea and not very effective). Then, he prescribed Ozempic. This has been making a huge difference so far. On the 0.25mg dose(1x a week), it has significantly killed my overall appetite(to the point of being unable to eat large amounts of anything), has increased the insulin effectiveness and so far, has helped me to start shedding the weight gained during Covid(which is the ultimate goal anyway). Total daily insulin is down to 90-110 units a day. I wanted to see if any other T1s have used Ozempic and have had similar successes. I know it's a t2 drug but am seeing very good results with it so far, about a month in.

Are there some pumps that double as a CGM? I currently use the Dexcom G6, but I really dont want to have to wear both a pump and a CGM. The main reason being that I really dont like wearing the CGM on my stomach, I just like it on my arm (Im assuming that I would have to rotate insertion sites to more than just from arm to arm if I am wearing both). Im a stomach sleeper, and, while I know sleeping on the Dexcom wont harm it or me, something about knowing that its being messed with/pushed in to me makes me feel icky. Its weird and I dont really know how to explain it, I just really dont like it.

Is the feeling/sensation of wearing a pump similar to a CGM?  I would expect the pump itself would be bigger than most any CGM's, but Im unsure of what to expect wearing one would be like aside from that.

28,"Balanced blood sugar levels are crucial to a healthy and prosperous life.

  
Balanced blood sugar levels prevent disruption of your body’s functions and help your overall health. Here are a few foods to add to your diet to help balance your blood sugar:

&amp;#x200B;

Greens:

You can never eat too many greens. For the best blood sugar benefits, go for nutrient-dense, low-carb greens like spinach, kale, and broccoli among many more. These greens are also very rich in protein and calcium, which help your body in multiple areas. You can toss these greens in salads with olive oil and chunks of salmon. Studies have shown that these three vegetables contribute to dramatic improvement in patients who are constantly battling with their blood sugar.

&amp;#x200B;

Low fructose fruits:

Fruit is always a must, but for blood sugar-specific management, choose fruits that are low fructose, such as raspberries, blueberries, kiwi, and blackberries. You can snack on them throughout the day, or toss them in your salad, smoothies, or acai bowls. It’s a good idea to add some healthy fats with your fruit so you don’t spike your sugar. This might mean mixing some almonds or healthy seeds with your berries.

&amp;#x200B;

Protein:

Protein is essential for slowing down glucose absorption in your body, which helps regulate your blood sugar levels. Add foods to your diet that are packed with protein, like wild salmon and other types of fish, beef and other types of lean meat, cottage cheese or Greek yogurt (if tolerated), and eggs. Make your diet interesting; try snack ideas like celery sticks dipped in organic unsweetened nut or seed butters. This snack is rich in protein and only contains the good kind of fat. Remember everything in moderation, however. Too much protein actually can become sugar in your blood, creating a condition called gluconeogenesis; 40 to 70 grams of protein is enough for a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Herbs and Spices:

Herbs and spices are natural supplements for balancing your blood sugar levels. They not only add flavor to your dishes but they may also help your hormone’s lower your blood sugar. Some spices, like turmeric, contain anti-inflammatory properties, which help in balancing out your sugar.

&amp;#x200B;

Drink Water:

Cut out sugary, high-calorie drinks from your diet. Add drinks like cinnamon tea, lemon water, and cucumber juice in your daily routine.

&amp;#x200B;

Whole grain foods:

Whole grain gluten free foods that are also rich in protein, like millet and quinoa, provide and store energy without causing spikes in your blood sugar levels.

&amp;#x200B;

Beans:

Beans are a good source of protein, low carb, and rich in fiber, all important factors in balancing your blood sugar. Hummus, lentils and garbanzo beans are good examples and great dietary choices. Remember to soak them the night before to promote easier digestion.

&amp;#x200B;

Nuts:

Nuts like almonds and walnuts contain healthy amounts of fiber, protein, and healthy fats, and are a low carb snack idea.

&amp;#x200B;

34,"I have been Type 2 for 9 years. During that time, my A1C ranges from 5.8 to 6.0 (my highest, this past checkup). I take 500mg Meformin at breakfast, and 500 at dinner (I tried 1000 timed release, but my morning levels were too high no matter when I took it).  
For the past 3 years, my morning fasting number has been between 115 and 130, depending on if a splurged a little at dinner and had fried food, or a couple of bites of dessert.

Since Dec., it's been much higher, ranging from 130 to 155. I tried adding an extra 250 mg of metformin per day, that didn't help. I tried eating earlier. No luck. I tried having a snack (small protein shake, some peanut butter, etc.) before bed. No help.   
So, for the past 6 days, I tried an experiment. First 2 nights, I went out to dinner and had a relatively 'normal' carb meal (chicken parm and salad one night, a burger on 1 slice of multi-grain bread the other night, with a side salad. Not typical for me - usually I'll have chicken over salad, or a chicken salad wrap but toss half the wrap. But I wanted a higher bedtime number. On those nights, when I went to bed at 10pm, my sugar was 148 one night, and 155 the other. I set an alarm for 3am and got up to check again. Both times it was about 5 points lower than when I went to bed. Then I checked again at 7am, my normal fasting check. 149, 157. So, it basically went down 5 points during the night and came up 5 points after 3am.  
The next two nights, I had nothing but steamed veggies for dinner (at 6pm), with some herbed butter on them. Bedtime numbers were 118 and 122. 3am numbers were 121 and 125. 7am numbers: 137 and 142. So on nights when my sugar is normal, somewhere between  3am and 7am there's a big jump.  
Finally, the past two nights, I did the steamed veggies again (6pm), but right before bed (10pm) I drank 5 ounces of a low-carb protein shake. Numbers: 120 and 125 at bedtime, 121 and 123 at 3am, and 139 and 147 at 7am.

Five days ago on Sunday I had been smoking on a loon(ecig) and I had been trying to quit for awhile and had kept relapsing. So my tolerance wasn't the same anymore, and I really rko'd myself. Took a dab, and then hit my loon two more times and that was it. I felt my tongue, and arm starting to go numb, a forehead punching migraine and SIXTEEN hours of vomiting. I basically camped out in my bath tub and just drank shit tons of fluids, and survived the night. Well the first couple days after I felt pretty shit. Sluggish, fatigued, nausea, headache, dizziness, vision that wouldn't cooperate quite right. After three days I had started to feel better so my dumb ass hit my loon once on Thursday. Well needless to say I have officially quit smoking as it ended up making me throw up for only two hours this time, and some lingering nausea. It's not day two since then and I still get a little bit of mild nausea but it almost feels more linked to my stomach being empty than it is actually having to throw up. So I'd eat and generally feel better but I guess my main curiosity is do you feel these symptoms would be strong enough indicators? As I have a pretty insane calorie intake due to my metabolism so I feel like I'd be dead already if I was newly diabetic? Like as an example.

&amp;#x200B;

I barely kept my eyes open so that i can drive home. Am obese, 162 Kgs at the time, so i thought to test my blood sugar near my house once i arrived and it was 270. I waited till the morning and tested again after 12 hours of fasting and STILL 270.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : After years of bad eating and being overweight my A1C is 9.3 and diagnosed T2.

&amp;#x200B;

So i went to a doctor and he gave me Metformin 1000 twice daily. And kid you not, that was the worst decision i have ever taken in my life. The Metformin made me a zombie, I would sit still for hours and i would wake up from a 12 hour sleep super tired and barely being able to get out of bed. I couldn't drive and my anxiety was so high, i feared going outside.

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks on metformin and i decided to stop it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was on a strict low carb diet, getting my carbs only from bell peppers and cottage cheese. I  ate boiled eggs and grilled chicken and 90% dark chocolate and occasionally some nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

I went from 162 kgs to 135 in 2.5 month sticking to this diet with no exercising at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

First month numbers :

Fasting : 140  mg/dl  

2hrs PP : 134  mg/dl  

&amp;#x200B;

After stopping metformin and getting on a healthy low carb diet :

&amp;#x200B;

Fasting: 90 - 101  with occasional dips to high 80's  

2hrs PP: 105 - 129 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now: 

&amp;#x200B;

2hrs PP:  116  mg/dl   after 3 boiled eggs and 8 grams of dark chocolate 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to share my story. This is not advice for any1 to stop taking his medicine. Every case is unique.

Approximately a year ago, I was taken to the hospital by ambulance and the blood work showed that I was at 550 BG and no one told me anything about having diabetes.

10 years ago I have record of being at 200 BG.

Out of concern, I ended up going on labsmd and ordered a C-Peptide test. Results were 0.20 ng/ml with a reference range of 0.80-3.85 ng/ml after fasting for 12 hours.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but is there anyone here that could offer some knowledge as to what could potentially be going on?

Last year, my routine blood work came back showing that my fasting BG was 111. My doctor pointed out that it was 1 point over the normal non-diabetic limit, and that she would keep an eye on it. Two years prior, my fasting BG was 109 - elevated, but normal.

This year, my fasting BG came back again at 111. While T2 doesn't run heavily in my family, one grandfather of mine did have it.

This happens regardless of what I eat, but it also happens with foods that have little carbs, though lesser in effect.

I called my doctor and she was surprised at the numbers because they seemed to come out of nowhere (especially because I’m eating the healthiest I have in my adult life and am under the least amount of stress in a decade).  So we did follow up blood work and it had gone even higher than before so she officially diagnosed me as being diabetic.

I had already started making changes to my diet (rather than eating out every day I cook a meal provided by everyplate for breakfast and use a Huel meal replacement drink for dinner, with no lunch). I also plan to get an exercise bike and start Tabata training.

So far the hardest part for me is what to drink. I've never enjoyed drinking water and drink mainly milk, but I've added a 1 liter bottle of Life Water to my routine. It's starting to get difficult because I used to drink anywhere from 1-6 cups of coffee a day, light and sweet. I'm trying to drink coffee with only milk added but it's a struggle.

39,"First time ever seeking help or advice from any other Diabetic. Ever. In 20 years of it. Bear with me, this is a bit of a tale.

So I got sold the 770g by a lying skeeving bitch at Medtronic, who failed to mention that in the three years since I last turned down Medtronic on their absolute shit of a CGM system, that seemingly the only advance is that your phone can tell you now instead of the meter. Oh, except if you use a fitbit. Cuz apparently that interferes with the phones ability to talk to your pump and meter.

Cuz that isn't a giant. Fucking. Health and safety concern they've known about since April 26th btw. 

So I been on the freestyle libre for about 3 1/2 years, love it to death, I got an old workhorse of a pump, the Medtronic minimed, that has worked flawlessly, for nearly ten years. Been diabetic for 20. Admittedly never been the best at taking care of it before then, because testing my sugar, fucking, sucks. My fingers, are really god damn sensitive. I feel the stick for HOURS afterwards, every time I move my fingers, it hurts. I work as a mechanic, I'm a gamer, a writer, miniatures painter, I use my fingers a LOT for delicate precise work, and finger sticks turn them into painful clubs that have splinters of pain in them every key press, brush stroke, etc. 

Call me a crybaby, what the fuck ever, you aren't attached to these fuckin fingers, you can't know how much finger sticks fuck me up and wear on my mental health. Just typing this, would hurt to the point of tears and I am one stoic motherfucker usually, Diabetes related things just have an amazing talent at making me insanely frustrated and angry. I made the decision long ago to stick to the arm sticks, I'm good with those.

So I got the libre, and other than one defective sensor, its been great. Pretty fire and forget. Got a new phone that reads them, don't have to carry around a separate tiny fucking meter to lose in life as a mechanic, can email my data to my doc directly, no bullshit middleman, it was great. Trust it enough to not check my blood sugars against it, never found more than a 20 point variance either way so I stopped testing my sugars altogether. Let me actually save a little fucking money as a diabetic for fucking once in my god damn millenial life. I only pay $500 a month in coverages, it's totally fine that my diabetic care and feeding is another.... $400-450 out of pocket after that for sensors insulin and supplies for my pump.

Side note, Fuck you American healthcare, moving on.

So three years ago they tried to upgrade me to a system that only lasts one week to the libre's 2, has a fucking battery for the sensors you have to recharge manually, that is 900 fucking dollars, as opposed to the libre's built in battery for 2 weeks for a $75 dollar package. This battery is very losable, and the sensors adhesive footprint is the size of a fucking pack of cigarettes. It's absurd and monstrous. My Libre is the size of a quarter, hangs out on the back of my arm, and doesn't give a fuck what happens to it, I'm a mechanic and get sweaty and dirty and not a one has ever failed that wasn't ripped off and that takes some EFFORT to get those off. Hell on purpose it can take some doing. 

So I tell them 'Are you fucking HIGH!? This is like, laughably worse than the Libre. Like, critically, from a gadget geek, this is an absolute. Joke. To me. So I tell them take a hike, call me on the next generation, Medtronic has said 'your money or your life to me' during an insurance transition and I've sent them my food budget for the month to be alive to starve for a while, its cool, I don't HATE THEM WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING OR ANYTHING.

So they call me a year ago to shriek again that the pump that has survived:

3 years as an appliance repairman, getting wet, banged around, and crushed into and under appliances,

2 years in tech school for mechanics getting rolled on slipping out 
of pockets, getting tools, parts, tires, etc, bashed into it, soaked in oil and antifreeze and god the fuck knows what else.

3 years as a mechanic for forklifts getting you get the idea. I've been soaked in rain, snow, hydraulic fluid, antifreeze head to toe fucking RUINED and this pump has taken more abuse without missing a TICK on the clock for 10 years, is out of warranty, and may fail. Well whatever. sell me. It can't be read by the phone yet, something I got the new phone to do with the Libre. Fucking joke, call me when it can do THAT.

So they finally do call me last month. I ask them, this is basically now on par with where the libre was 4 years ago? No bullshit? Hook up the sensor, fire and forget automatic delivery, pump and CGM talk, I don't have to fuck with anything else, at all anymore?

And the fucking joke Medtronic CGM, that only lasts a week, that has a losable $900 battery I have to recharge, that has a giant adhesive footrpint, that would itch like hell and I'd lose or break that battery every fucking day etc etc etc, that's gone right?

They say right! It's all good now! I say fuck yeah. They say 12,000 dollars. I say uhfuck, get financial aid from Medtronic even though I feel I'm owed the damn thing free considering I've been financially hamstrung by them for my entire adult life and probably have given them 30,000 out of pocket over the years, and rip my insurance a new anus because I haven't upgraded in 10 years when this is normally like, an every other year thing for most I imagine, and I get the fucking thing. Oh and a free totebag too!

Cuz that's what I fucking need.

So not only is the CGM still with that detachable battery, giant adhesive footprint, only lasts a week, not only does the fucking thing not even WORK with the phone to update you with a fitbit around (Seriously, there will be a class action lawsuit about this. That is fucking *Dangerous*) Not only do you now HAVE to carry the sugar meter around with you as well as the pump, Apparently you also have to CALIBRATE THE FUCKING CUNT AT LEAST TWICE A DAY.

Yeah. Three finger stick ONLY, no arm allowed, blood sugar tests one the first day of the week long lifespan, then a new one every 12 hours, for the week.

So now I'm not only back to the fucking finger sticks, I now have the financial deadweight of fucking test strips and lancets back that the Libre had freed me from more or less, and I'm back to carrying the fucking meter around again, this time without even the perk of being able to leave it in my toolbox or whatever because bluetooth ain't THAT good. There's almost no fucking point to this in my eyes. Sure I'll have more automated management and more time in range but just... 

The drain on my mental health and stress level would fucking kill me long before Diabetes even got near doing the job. This tech, seems objectively worse, and just... Twirling on the spot. The only significant advancement I can track is the phone being in the loop and the automation. Apparently the sensor reads insulin levels too which is... Yay. I guess. Not like my pump doesnt know how much I have in me. Sure it can't detect when I have an infusion set clog for the most part, but fucking a. This seems a pathetic limp dick software update with no hardware advancement. 

Like... Fuck the strips and lancets, assuming I can even hack the finger sticks which is a big if, that's gonna be another $100 a month probably, so now I'm essentially paying both the Libre cost, and the meter costs, rather than the one or the other I am on, that I am spending just being fucking *alive*. Like... I don't make bad money. At all. But this is just another hamstring, another financial anchor, and a giant step BACK in functionality vs existing tech, that I just Can. Not. Fucking. Justify.

After speaking with Medtronic support during my training on the new pump because it doesn't want to fucking talk to my phone or the meter with my fitbit app active, so I had to unsync, uninstall the app, restart my phone, then they could all talk again, I get told, that I was fucking lied to. By like, 4 reps. Not a god damn thing of this was talked about, there wasn't even a fucking meter DISCUSSED in the cost line items of pump, sensors, etc, before I received the package and there it was on the receipt. I very nearly said 'Fuck all this bullshit' to a very nice old lady who trains people at my office and let her send the crap back. I honestly probably would have if I hadn't left two boxes of sensors at home I KNOW these miserable fucking bastards would find a way to charge me for. Stormed out of my docs office, so mad I could barely *see* straight after being so fucking boldfaced lied to by a company that again, said 'your money or your life' when I ran out of infusion sets during an insurance transition, and I had to give them literally every dollar I had, and now they want me to give them control over my CGM as well as my pump supplies and I gotta fork out for lancets and test strips for the first time in years again too?!

Like... I feel like I am pretty honestly justified in thinking, that this tech, is an absolute joke, because it hasn't advanced in nearly 4 years, and arguably has gotten fucking WORSE. And I'm supposed to trust my life to this system? This Pump? This sugar meter fucking AGAIN that I am SURE is only there to fucking nickel and dime diabetics even worse? Cuz honestly I feel like we're almost at Diabetic devices acting like fucking printers and their ink. 'Only Medtronic Insulin allowed. You have 48 units left in the vial, sadly it has expired. Get fucked and pay us, peasant.'

Please, bring me down to earth if I'm wrong and give me some perspective because this seems like a fucking practical joke it's so bad and such a step backwards. Sorry for the wall of text and I suck ass at tl;dr's, but I'm honestly near of breaking down and crying again, or calling Medtronic and ripping about 78 new anuses open and getting the CEO's address so I can sink the Yacht I've given him a down payment on to have the audacity of wanting to be *fucking alive*",diabetes,"Am I wrong in thinking the shiny new Medtronic 770G is just, a GIANT step backwards technologically from the Freestyle Libre and a 10 year old pump?

A couple of days ago, I posted some questions and got some great answers and more support than I had ever imagined, so I am back with another burning question. Shout out for being a great community.

My initial diagnosis was T2D but after a trip to the endocrinologist and c-peptide and GAD autoantibody tests, my doctor has diagnosed me as most likely T1D. 

Pre-COVID, I traveled internationally for my job at least once a year, and sometimes more. Often, my work takes me to Europe and Latin America. I speak Spanish fluently, so I know I can communicate my diagnosis well enough to navigate airports, restaurants, and other common situations, but I am really insecure about the dietary challenges involved with travel. Another complication is that I eat a plant-based diet. My main concern is what happens when a) I have significant time changes to deal with, like when I travel to Germany, and b) how to get the proper food when I don't read or speak the language. I am sure there are practical things I can reference, like google translate, but I was curious what resources people here use. Another thing that concerns me is that I am usually on my feet walking for 10-12 miles a day when on these trips, and I worry about getting hypoglycemic from exercise. As my blood sugar is still wildly uncontrolled by medications, I have a hard time envisioning this working. However, my doc does recommend a pump and CGMS once I have proven I can handle the dietary requirements.

I went from doing nothing to doing a minimum of 60 minutes a day of moderate to high intensity exercise, mostly Beat Saber and Hitstream (sideloaded boxing type game). I'm able to do 45 minute sessions now, my stamina has increased dramatically, I work up a solid sweat and average a BPM of 120-160 with ease and burn anywhere from 500-750+ cals extra a day. I'm pushing for faster paced exercise now and hope to do Expert+ levels in Beat Saber in the next couple of weeks.

I took a couple of rest days the last month, two because the COVID vaccine wiped me out for several days, and a few others to see if rest days helped.

You'd think this would help my diabetes out a lot, but NOPE. I've almost doubled my TDD, and I'm spending more time high than I am in range. When I was very sedentary, I had over 75% in range with my range being 4-8.5mmol. My diet hasn't changed either, it's still the same as it was before. Even if I don't eat all day I keep rising, especially during and after exercise. I upped my basal and ratios and still struggle.

The one thing I can think of is that I haven't been sleeping well. I average 4-5 hours a night and I suspect this is what's keeping me higher than I want to be, but I honestly don't know why exercise isn't denting my numbers more. I'm going at it pretty hard, and I don't see improved sensitivity later on in the day either. After a month I was hoping to see some progress in that, but I'm still stuck here.

It's a bit frustrating to say the least. When I do lower intensity stuff like taking a walk, I'm extremely likely to drop hard with my glucose levels, but it's boring as shit and I don't really want to be outside more than I need to be for a while longer.

I'm honestly wondering if there's another person who was pretty insulin sensitive before (I averaged 40-55u TDD before this) and is suddenly seeing the opposite with this kind of exercise. If so, do you know what caused it? Any tips to remedy it? I'm going to focus on trying to get more sleep to start with, but I'm open to suggestions!",diabetes,VR exercises and glucose levels,1621514882

78,"TL;DR: 
Lost 40lbs on miracle drug, completely changed my life and lifestyle. Doc that I see was also my boss and was putting staff at HUGE unnecessary COVID risk so left the job and then lost insurance. Accepted a job offer but it will be 3-4 mos before I'm eligible to enroll in their insurance plan. Devastated that I am gaining weight since being off Ozempic. Wondering if anyone might have unused pens that they don't need, that they could send to me - because if so, I would love you forever and would SO grateful. 

---
I've been on Ozempic for a year or so now, and it has been truly life changing for me. I have lost almost 40lbs and have never felt better. Also due to the weight loss I am able to be much more mobile and have become so much stronger, being able to work out and be physically active. 

Well, I was working at a physician's office and he was also seeing me as his patient and was the one prescribing the Ozempic to me. 

Well, about a month ago I had a sort of argument with the doctor I worked for. I spoke up at an office meeting about a few different COVID patient scenarios where he completely put all of the staff at unnecessary risk (ie, a COVID positive patient was leaving the office, dr went to med sample closet &amp; grabbed an inhaler for the patient bc he had a severe cough. In the middle of the hallway, in front of the nurse's station, dr told patient to remove his mask &amp; take 2 puffs from the inhaler, which resulted in the patient violently coughing all over us/the nurses station/2 other patients in the hall who were seeing another dr. also having a positive COVID patient come in after talking on the phone with him, &amp; choosing to do an extensive annual wellness visit physical on top of the sick visit so that he could bill the patients insurance for more $, without telling any of the staff that the patient was COVID +, &amp; basically forcing us have prolonged &amp; unnecsssary contact w/ the patient, among other things.) 

After the office meeting, nothing improved in terms of his handling COVID patients &amp; he was snapping at me daily, treating me like shit, making me so uncomfortable &amp; miserable, so I ultimately decided to find employment elsewhere &amp; quit. 

My predicament is that I now no longer have insurance. I have accepted a new position but I don't start working for another almost month. I will get insurance, but I have to wait through a 90 day probationary period before I qualify for insurance. 

It's been 3 weeks off of Ozempic and my appetite is increasing, and I'm starting to gain weight back, despite exercise &amp; mostly eating ""good"" foods. I'm almost certain that if I go 3-4 months without it, I will be right back where I started, struggling with exercise and constantly being exhausted and so disheartened at all the progress I made and will end up losing. 

I fought through months of nausea/vomiting while trying to adjust to the medication, I have put in so much work in the gym and finally feel strong and healthy and my mood had improved so much. My self confidence was up. I was able to hike with my huskies and my active SO. I'm absolutely devastated. 😢😓

I forked up the cash to pay for a ""self pay"" office visit w/ another dr to see if I could get samples from them, but they ended up not carrying Ozempic samples. Said they would talk to their drug rep &amp; see if they could get some, but they've heard nothing back &amp; could only offer me a prescription. But even with a GoodRx coupon, a 1 month supply would cost me $897, which I can't afford. I looked into the patient assistance program, but with that, I would have to show proof that I lost my job due to COVID, but technically since I was not let go, I do not qualify. 

Anyways, to my main point for this post: 
I know many ppl have tried Ozempic and did not like/could not tolerate the extreme nausea/vomiting/abdominal symptoms. I was wondering if anyone on here has any Ozempic pens, that they may have gotten as samples or that they filled as prescriptions but ended up not using them and changing to something else? 
If so, would you be able to do me the biggest solid EVER &amp; send them to me? I can pay shipping! It would mean the absolute world to me, and I would be so, SO grateful. I could even do Victoza if anyone has that (same as Ozempic but daily injections instead of weekly.)

Even if it's just one single pen, that could get me through for a month if I maintain the lower dose, while I try to see if I can find other people who might also have a spare pen. 
I've been so stressed out about this, trying to figure out a plan, and I'm pretty much out of ideas, so figured I would try to reach out to you this community.

91,"Hi, I'm here on behalf of my mom. She has had T1D since I've been alive and she is extremely good about managing her blood sugar. Unfortunately, she is suffering from kidney failure and has to be on certain medications to reserve her kidney function. However, these medications raise her blood sugar by 200 - 300 points. She takes insulin to counteract these high blood sugars. 

Today, she became hypoglycemic. She uses a dexcom g6 to measure her blood sugar, but it did not give her an accurate reading at all. The dexcom gave her a reading of 116 while when she manually tested it gave her a reading of 37. Luckily, I was there. I had her eat things high in glucose like apple juice, raisins, sugary cereal. She was still not doing good and she couldnt walk or think straight at all so I had to carry her out to the car and drive her to the ER. I was about ready to give her a Glucagon injection, but thankfully she came to and her blood sugar slowly started to rise. She started to feel better and by the time we turned around from the ER and got back home she could think much better and her blood sugar was at 85. 

Its been about 90 minutes and her blood sugar is 137. The dexcom reads 160. So it's being extremely inaccurate, even after recallibration. **I ask on behalf of my mom if there is a better piece of technology (glucose reader) that can accurately read blood sugars and actually notify you frequently what a persons blood sugar is.

1,"Hi so I am 38 and my brother has childhood-onset T1. I also had GD with one of my pregnancies. I have had some ups and downs with my weight and am currently in the overweight BMI category. I was diagnosed in August when I went to urgent care with terrible symptoms and it turned out I had an a1c of 11 and BG was near 400 fasting. Since then I had changed my diet and been on metformin and glyburide and reached an a1c of 6.2 a couple months ago. I also had lost some weight. My PCP stopped the glyburide at that point because I was reaching BG in the 70s between meals. My BG levels increased after stopping the glyburide but still within acceptable ranges under the circumstances. I was eating low carb/no refined sugar. Not keto-level low carb but average of probably 50-70 net carbs daily and tons of fiber. I ran out of test strips and haven't been testing for the past few weeks. This was apparently dumb, I guess I got over confident. 

Fast forward to last week when I had a lapse in self-control and ate a bunch of pastries, probably my first ""real"" sugar consumption since being diagnosed. I knew I had a high BG and felt like garbage but did not test, just continued the metformin and low carb diet thinking it would go down. 4 days later when I still felt gross so I went to get more test strips and my fasting BG was 276. PCP has me back on the glyburide and testing frequently, the lowest I've gotten in the past few days since then was 222. 

So now my PCP is going to refer me to an endo to consider the possibility that I have something between Type 1 and Type 2. Has anyone else experienced this?

So i've been suffering from fatigue for months, so decided to get one of those at home blood test kits. I figured i'd try and avoid the doctors with the whole Covid situation if I could. So the results came back, and my Hba1c was ""very high"" at 77 mmol. Placing me well into the diabetic range, so they advised I go to my local doctors and get blood tests redone to confirm, so I should get it confirmed in a few days, but I have no reason to suspect the results will be any better. I'm overweight and my diet was awful (I ate a lot of sugary food). 

Fatigue is the only symptom I had though, no excessive thirst or peeing etc. So anyway, as I figure I most likely do have it, i'm sorting my diet and exercise out anyway before it's confirmed. I purchased a blood glucose tester so I can monitor my levels, and so far, I think it's going okay with my new low carb zero-sugary-food diet. My figures so far:  


Morning before eating anything: 5.8 to 6.0 mmol (A little high i think?)

90 minutes after eating an apple and yoghurt for lunch: 7.8 mmol

Two hours after eating some eggs and chicken: 5.8mmol

Late evening 5 hours after my last meal: 4.9mmol

  
I'm just wondering what people think about those figures ? I'm really hoping I can control my suspected type 2 via dieting alone. I'm not sure if the 7.8 reading is high considering I just ate an apple and yoghurt?, though I guess apples are fairly high in sugar. Also a bit confused why my morning reading would be higher than my late evening one, seeing as it's even longer than without food.

1. They claim you will become more hypo aware if you run high,  but I have not found that with the newer insulins?   Anyone agree?  Also without a CGM it is very tough if I don't test 2 hours after a meal to know whether my I'm low or not because there are no physical symptoms.
2. I love closed loop pump and CGM but this sort of behavior really concerns me.   Do MDI people just set a 2 hour alarm so they know if the drop?

The blood pressure was always hard to control, so I've only just started adderall (1x/day, 15mg er) on 5/2, and I was so encouraged by my blood pressure being fine and how much clearer my head was even on day one! I was thinking maybe upping my dose at my next checkup would make the small improvement even better, so it was frustrating when I noticed how it was raising my fasting BG. Previously, my fasting numbers were between 85-105. Since starting adderall, my fasting numbers are usually between 120-150. Of course when I Googled it, I see that this is common.

Since I noticed this change, I've adjusted my eating so I'm getting calories about every 3-4hrs, and tried a small snack before bed, but it doesn't seem to help. The adderall hasn't affected my appetite, but my appetite hasn't been that substantial for the last few years normally, so eating more would have been hard anyway. I started cinnamon supplements on 5/11, but I think it's too soon to know if that is helping yet. I started getting back to exercise yesterday, so again, too soon to see results (I think?), but I'm not really sure when the best time to do it is? I've been doing it 30mins after a meal, aiming for breakfast and dinner on days off and at least dinner on work days.

I saw my doctor yesterday, and we agreed to try to keep these meds as they are for 3 months to see if I can adjust, and recheck my A1C then to see if it's affecting me as much as I think. I really want to try everything I can to make this work, as I am starting to think getting my brain to actually work right might be a key factor in finally dealing with lifelong depression and mental health issues. 😅 Sorry for the novel, but I'm really frustrated.

40,"I’ve been a Type 1 diabetic since age 8. It’s been two long decades since my diagnosis. That’s a long time to adhere the standards of diabetes diet requirements. This, coupled with being female, has lead to periods of disordered eating during my time with diabetes, especially during my teen years and when I was with my ex. My version of disordered eating was what I would characterize as orthorexia, coupled with addiction to running 20+ miles a week. While my doctors praised my healthy habits with diabetes, those were the points in time when I was the most depressed and had body image issues. 

Since then, I’ve had a lot to time and therapy to unprogram from those habits and behaviors. I am considered overweight now when compared to those teen years, but the difference is that I am happy and confident in my own skin. My cholesterol is good, my a1c is in range, I do not have vascular issues, am now able to exercise and eat without crippling anxiety.

I have a couple of reasons for sharing my story today. 

The first is that I encourage everyone to focus on finding balance in their treatment management. While eating salads and running 3 miles a day could be optimal for some diabetics, it could someone else’s personal struggle and mental agony to maintain that standard. We are not perfect, we emotionally complex humans with great guestimating skills.

While there are certain rules that must adhered most of the time for optimal health, we mustn’t level our own expectations on other diabetics. It should be our place to provide encouragement and support, because while you may be the poster child for diabetes, another person may be in full blown diabulemia.

The medical community is not always the best at advocating what is best for the patient. Your doctor can tell you to do X,Y and Z, but they don’t live your day-to-day life. If your medical support team is inflexible, not encouraging, lays judgement or is not understanding of your circumstances, then you need to run the other direction. They are there to look at you from a purely physical standpoint, but if whole well-being and mental health advocacy are not part of the equation, then they are falling short to recognize that mental health is critically important to ensuring physical outcomes in diabetes. When someone is struggling with disordered eating, a doctor telling someone to just eat less carbs for optimal glucose outcomes can be like throwing kerosene onto an already burning dumpster fire. Ultimately it is up to us to advocate for ourselves, but this hard to do when you are in denial or the middle of crisis.

Lastly, for those struggling with disordered eating, I want you to know you are not alone. You are loved and are important. The hardest part is asking, but know that you can get the help and support you need. I’ll leave the following resource below:

45,"Hi friends!

So, I’m currently waiting on my A1C results because a fasting glucose level suggested prediabetes.

HOWEVER, I’ve been told by many people to think about getting some tests to rule out T1 or 1.5. This is because most factors don’t really make me a candidate for T2. I’m 15, not overweight, used to run 6 days a week before the test, etc.

But, what makes me suspicious is that I’ve never had a problem with unexpected random weight loss. Whenever I’ve lost weight it’s because I was actively trying to. Yet all I hear is stories about how people lost tons of weight?

Sorry if I’m clueless! I haven’t researched much about T1 because I’ve been exhausting myself on T2 research.

Regardless, I’ve adapted a much healthier low-carb lifestyle in case it is not type 1/1.5. Can’t say if I’m losing weight quickly or not, but as I said it’s very unlikely to be from anything more than the diet.

47,"A month ago, my PCP flounced into the room and announced that my blurry vision, extreme fatigue, thirst, constant urination, and weight loss (16 pounds in one month!) were all likely mental health related. He ran bloodwork to placate me, and then called me back the next day without even a little remorse and said, ""well, you feel bad because you're type II diabetic."" He prescribed Metformin and told me to look at the Mayo Clinic website for ideas on how to manage it. Two days later, my best friend drove six hours to help me because I was incoherent on the phone, and when she saw how emaciated and sick I was, she called an ambulance. I was in DKA and had lost the ability to think clearly or do anything for myself, and my doctor being so casual confused me about whether anything was really wrong with me. His cavalier attitude nearly killed me. In the subsequent weeks, going only off of the information the hospital pharmacist gave me over the phone, my blood sugar has crashed and spiked like crazy, leaving me feeling terrible, even after I recovered from the dehydration of DKA. For over a month, my eyes have been so terrible that I cannot even road signs or discern people's expressions. What's worse is I've had to live with my mom (I am 44) in my house because she's scared of what can happen to me, and as someone who spent the last year alone working from home and social distancing, it's making me crazy. 

Yesterday, I finally got in to see an endocrinologist, who thinks I have type I instead of type II. She wants to put me on a longer-acting insulin and change my short-acting insulin, and even discussed a pump and the under the skin glucose meter so I don't have to prick my fingers every day.  She even sat me down with an education session with the pharmacist about how to properly dose my insulin. I left feeling more optimistic than I have in over a month, but got home to the pharmacy calling to tell me my insurance won't cover the insulin she recommends. 

Everything with this disease is so frustrating. I have had the good luck of working from home, so I can't imagine how this wears on people with ""real"" jobs, but my work requires the use of my eyes, which are terrible right now. I actually forgot to ask the endo about this because I was so shocked to hear type I instead of type II, but my PCP (who I'm not returning to) said it should return to normal when my blood sugar stabilizes.

I have a degree in exercise and nutrition and have always been active usually in two sports. I'm currently an active powerlifter.

Body:

I started gaining large amounts of weight from about the age of 8 on. From this point through my 20s I've been playing multiple sports and lifting weights. I've spent different times of my life eating low carb or ketogenic (&lt;20g carb per day) and counting every calorie (by weight), including a 2 year stretch between 16-18. 

During that time period I lost 20lbs in 2 weeks and my weight didn't budge beyond that. Any subsequent time I've lost between 0 and 20 lbs, and still my weight didn't budge. Currently I have ballooned just north of 300lbs.

And once you show a little careless attitude towards it or towards your health, get prepared to face the hard coming time. Whenever you take something on your nerves, it creates a factor of fear in your mind. For instance, if we take an example of diabetes, most of the people go under shock after hearing for the first time about their disease. For most of them it is hard to accept this fact and they are diabetic and this creates a sense of insecurity and fear in their mind that how they can cope with disease?

It is pretty much like a person who is learning how to drive? For him it is difficult to understand the difficult techniques of driving in start. So, whenever he sits on a driving seat he has some fears – fears of losing control, getting hit to someone or sustaining any injury etc. being a new to driving gear, there are certainly thousands of thing to remember along with concentrating on the road.

In fact, it is your fear and uncertainty that force you to think like that otherwise there only few things to ponder over like your concentration, acceleration, braking, steering etc. it sonly the fear that divert your attention from main point and you feel uneasy. Same is the case with diabetes. There is nothing big to worry about except keep some basics things in mind, but your fear overcome you and force you to sink in undesirable thoughts.

Being a diabetic, you need to focus on only few vital things and the things will automatically be under control for your. You need to have a frequent check on your blood glucose, your eating habits and of course, you physical activities. You don't have a long list of things or severe symptoms to worry about. Whenever you feel that things are getting out of control, simply contact your doctor.

Perhaps, sometimes it is good to have fear, as it keeps people more motivated and concerned towards their diabetes. Their fear keeps them away from doing foolish things and helps them to maintain a good healthy diabetes plan. But still don't let this fear overpower you at any stage of your diabetic life for it can bring drastic effect in your life. Fear is something that stops the progress by paralyzing your mind as you are unable to think properly what is right and what is wrong for you.

It is better to overpower your fear rather than let it overpower you. Only in this way you can be able to fight your disease more accurately and properly. If at any stage of your life, you feel that you are unable to control your fear, contact your doctor talk to him and follow his advice to overcome your fear.",diabetes,Managing Diabetes Without Fear,1621273582

So I'm not going to get into all the specifics of WHY we are doing this, but I don't mind answering questions to give context.

Patient: 3.5 year old daughter, I had gestational diabetes with her that went undetected until she was born. She failed one of her post birth sticks, passed all the rest for release at 2 days old (or 3, can't remember off top my head) and has had random issues since that come, clear up, and then go (e.g. food allergies). Recently (5ish months) she has been having sporadicsymptoms that her pedi thought were seizures, one morning with my parents she had said symptoms and a blood glucose of low 60's (my monitor, moms monitor and dads monitor) 

Device: my dad's insurance switched him from Libre 14 day to Dexcom, so he had extra Libres, so we figured why not see what is going on with her. Being 3, sticking her fingers multiple times a day is a real pain in the ass. Also has Bubble, we track with diabox.

Computer: not even a year old gaming computer, I doubt its the issue, but its a dell.

Cord: same cord my dad used prior to switch. Also have used SEVERAL of mine.

Accesories: bubble, diabox

Now, with her reading being in the 50's and 60's despite giving her appropriate food (for context, dad is diabetic, mom is a nurse, second mom is diabetic) it gets 120, then crashes back to 60's, my meter shows maybe 5 above the Libre i'd really like to share this data when I go to the ER in a few, or send to her pedi. Issue is, the Libre box says its connected to the computer, computer sees the sensor box, libreview won't connect to the sensor box freader thing. 

I also cannot get the Libre sensor on her arm to be read by the Libre app with my razr phone (new in January 2021), it works with the senor box. My tablet has no NFC.

Important note regarding her care so nobody worries, right now we are visiting my parents for the summer or we would be off to CHOA and this would be handled, as is, I am driving my dad to appointments in New Endland so immediate care is tricky although we are in contact with her pedi and trying to get her to an endocrinologist here and then transfer her home when we return in mid July. Right this second she is ""crashing again"" after a second round of food to try and raise so after my youngest and dad are home ill bring her to the er for a double check, with or without the transferable data) 


Im hoping maaaaaybe someone has ideas :) 

Again, I left out a LOT of back story, I dont mind answering questions!

Of course I've taken down my insulin doses, slowly, one unit a day (trying to find the new balance). I am still lowering the insulin bar and I am still in hypo. How? I make a correction, eat half a banana, and and hour later, I'm in red numbers again. 5-6 hypoglycemic events a day, all in red at night from like 3am till I wake up. It's crazy.

75,"Last year in October, I was diagnosed with type 2. Up until that time, I had no symptoms other than the week I was diagnosed. My a1c was 9.8 and they got me going on metformin. I switched from my primary care doctor to an endocrinologist to make sure I could treat it more effectively. I am 33 and at the time, my weight was maybe 175 and I am 6' tall and am a male. My primary care and endocrinologist were both surprised my a1c was so high and my weight was pretty normal. Since then, I had dropped about 30 pounds from my eating habits changing and from getting back to running/exercising. 

At my first endocrinologist apt, my a1c had dropped to 6.9. My next apt 4 months later (and after Christmas had passed) it was 6.7. Admittedly, I didn't eat like I should around Christmas with all the sweets around. Still, I was glad to see the a1c drop a little and my endocrinologist said she was happy and to keep working at it. She also said that, since I was doing what I need to do, I didn't need to be crazy about checking my sugar... so I definitely relaxed on that.

10 days ago, my wife and I went on vacation and I knew I would be a little relaxed when it came to my sugar. I forgot to take my tester with me and basically ate like I would before I found out about my diagnosis. I was good about taking my metformin (1500 mg, extended release). I drank alcohol which I rarely do at home (especially not the fruity type mixed drinks I was drinking on vacation). I felt like I could sense my sugar rising as my vision wasn't as clear as what it normally is. I am the only one in my family that doesn't wear glasses or contacts and have great vision but I noticed reading anything from a distance was hard as the lines were not sharp on the letters. Still, I kept doing what I was doing. I really only ever drink water with every now and then making an exception. 

When we got home last night, our last hoorah was to get frozen yogurt as we never made time to do it on our vacation. After eating mine, I thought I should check my sugar and it was extremely high. 659. I about cried seeing it and pumped more water in my system to try and help to get it to drop. I also had some of my old metformin that was immediate release and took one of those to try and help. Before I went to bed, it was down to about 500. This morning it was 350.

I know I need to get back on the horse with my eating and drinking and am super bummed I let it get away from me. Anyone else have something like this happen to them? Did your blurriness go away in your eyes when your sugar got back into a more normal range like maybe 150-180?

I go back to my endocrinologist next month and am hoping to get everything back on track so my a1c doesn't go up ... but am nervous that's out of the question now.

I'm a picky eater struggling to really revamp my diet... but I am trying and have made big changes to it since October... just feel like I have majorly let myself down with this vacation :(",diabetes,High sugar after vacation,1621263519

Got a lot of blood work done last week - A1c is now 4.6!!! Super happy - now will see if I can get that metformin dose down. Also I still have some weight to lose (down about 15 lbs since diagnosis) so that should help too.

92,"Diagnosed in February with an A1C of 10.6. I am a 24 year old female.

I am currently taking 2000 mg metformin and 1 mg glimepiride daily.

I am in the situation that my fasting numbers every morning are always between 85-110. Only once has it been up to 125. 

I ate to my meter for a while, and never spiked above 140 except with specific foods. I cut those foods out. I used to drink only soda all the time, constantly. I was able to cut back to drinking soda only at meals, and less than half the amount I normally would. Water all the time otherwise. I occasionally do random checks throughout the day, and I'm rarely over 140.

I eat like shit. Lots of fast food. Never liked sweets, so that wasn't difficult aside from soda. But I eat bad. Even when I cook at home, it's bad. It's a long story, but I've had quite a year and changing my entire life was the last thing on my mind; even though I go into a depressive episode every day about dying early from diabetes.

(An unrelated aside for women interested: After a decade of having only 3 horrible month-long periods a year and battling infertility, I'm finally having regular cycles thanks to metformin. Here's to hoping for a baby.)

Now that all the information is presented, here's my question:

I am a reasonably disciplined person with most things, but I'm finding it hard to motivate myself to change my diet when my numbers are good with just the medication. Being in the pre-diabetic range or normal range most of the time is making it difficult to make drastic changes, when in my mind, they're not necessary.

My biggest concern is numbness in my left leg. Not my foot or toes, but my shin. So even though my numbers are rarely very high (above 140), I feel like my body is still suffering from diabetes.

Can anyone explain this to me? I know the first explanation may be ""you're missing your spikes,"" but I assure you that I am autistic and eat the same meals constantly. I have tested the same exact foods at all possible intervals and on multiple days. Even if I am missing occasional spikes, it seems unlikely to be statistically significant.

And if you don't have an explanation for what's going on, would anybody be able to help me by telling me the long-term effects and efficiency of the medications I'm currently on? Will they eventually stop working or something?

Thanks.",diabetes,"Good numbers, bad management?",1621223777
93,"Has anyone had issues with their insurance shorting your supplies? My insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield of KS) keeps shorting my stuff and won't give me a recourse or suggestions on how fix the issue.

My doctors have been changing my medications around and increased how many times I have to test (I text at minimum 6 times a day, I'm trying to get a CGM, but it's taking forever) and my insurance will only give me 100 strips because two boxes would put me over a month by two days. I'm short by almost 70 strips. I have no idea what to do. 

They've also shorted my insulin because two vials would put me over by two days. Two fucking days. Luckily I can buy the insulin I need OTC at Walmart. 

Now they've shorted my blood pressure medication that Ive been instructed to take three times a day. I'm thirty pills short and they won't give them to me. I'm probably going to have to buy them out of pocket.

94,"   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've been diagnosed as Type 1 since I was 17, I'm 23 now. I've been slacking on keeping track of my sugars for the last year or so. I'm newly engaged, working a new job, just moved into a house for the first time, the last thing I wanted to do was stab myself repeatedly to check my blood sugar. I mean I can feel when I'm high and I've never had DKA, not too big of a deal I thought, so I just started slacking. And then I started fudging carb counts, rounding, and estimating, sometimes just forgetting to give insulin until hours later. Horrible idea, but I was burnt out and couldn't be bothered.

   
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Welp, last Thursday I had to leave work throwing my guts up. Got home and spent the next three hours heaving to the point where I expected organs to start coming up. Should've been obvious it was DKA but I didn't even think of it, I surely hadn't been that bad right? Lol nope, I was that bad and was paying for it. Called my mom for some Zofran and she sees me and rushes me to the hospital instantly. I'm rushed in for DKA with my BG at 314 (not a crazy high number but who knows how long it was that high), insulin drip, shit-tons of fluid and the like. It was bar none the worst I have ever felt in my life. I was dry heaving for hours after being admitted and was so dehydrated that my kidneys were starting to function poorly. That back pain had me screaming for fucking hours despite constant pain medication, they did several CT scans bc they were sure I had a kidney stone (I didn't). 

  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My A1C came back at 11, my highest since I first got diagnosed. I'm prepping myself for some justified beratement from my endo and my primary. They kept me there until this afternoon because my electrolytes were all super low, but I'm finally home now. Just put in a new order for G6 sensors and some more pump supplies. so I can start taking this shit seriously again. It was a horrible fucking experience but my dumb ass needed the wake-up call.
